0;36405443;A comparison of sutureless flanged fixation and 4-point Gore-Tex fixation for scleral-fixated intraocular lenses: a pilot study.;[];Digital journal of ophthalmology : DJO;"Scleral-fixation of intraocular lenses (IOLs) provides an option for eyes that lack sufficient capsular support for in-the-bag IOL placement. The latest techniques for lens fixation include use of a novel suture material, Gore-Tex, and a sutureless method, with flanged intrascleral fixation. The purpose of this pilot study was to compare these methods in terms of anatomic and clinical outcomes.
A total of 35 eyes of patients 18-60 years of age who presented with aphakia, subluxated lens, or ectopia lentis were randomized into two groups. Group A (15 eyes) underwent flanged intrascleral IOL fixation using the Yamane technique; group B (20 eyes) underwent 4-point transscleral fixation of IOL using Gore-Tex suture. The following parameters were compared between groups on day 1, week 3, and month 6 postoperatively: logMAR uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity, retinoscopy, IOL centration on slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and IOL tilt on ultrasound biomicroscopy.
Postoperative visual acuity was better in group B: uncorrected, logMAR 0.89 ± 0.22 versus 0.72 ± 0.24 (

3;35948879;Visual performance, safety and patient satisfaction after bilateral implantation of a trifocal intraocular lens in presbyopic patients without cataract.;['Multifocal Intraocular Lenses', 'Patient satisfaction', 'Presbyopia', 'Refractive lens exchange', 'Trifocal', 'Visual function'];BMC ophthalmology;"The aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a trifocal intraocular lens (IOL) for the correction of presbyopia and to assess patient satisfaction.
Records from three centres were reviewed to select presbyopic patients having undergone bilateral refractive lens exchange and implantation of the AT LISA tri 839MP multifocal IOL. Postoperatively, monocular and binocular distance, intermediate and near visual acuities, corrected and uncorrected, and subjective refraction were measured. Patients also completed a quality of life questionnaire. Safety evaluation included IOL stability and postoperative complications.
72 eyes (36 patients) were analysed. No clinically significant difference between pre- and postoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was found for monocular or binocular measurements. Mean postoperative monocular CDVA was 0.02 ± 0.04 logMAR. Mean refractive values all improved statistically significantly compared with preoperative baseline (p ≤ 0.0064). Overall, 82.4% of eyes had spherical equivalent within ± 0.5 D and 97.1% within ± 1.0 D of emmetropia with a mean accuracy of -0.10 ± 0.41 D. Spectacle independence for distance, intermediate and near visual acuity was 87.5%, 84.4% and 78.1% respectively, and 78.1% of patients were satisfied with their postoperative, spectacle-free vision.

If these eyes still have nonadult ELPs as they age, this could result in persistently large PE. We aimed to determine whether ELP or biometry at age 10½ years correlated with PE in children enrolled in the Infant Aphakia Treatment Study (IATS).
We compared the measured refraction of eyes randomized to primary IOL implantation to the ""predicted refraction"" calculated by the Holladay 1 formula, based on biometry at age 10½ years. Eyes with incomplete data or IOL exchange were excluded. The PE (predicted - measured refraction) and absolute PE were calculated. Measured anterior chamber depth (ACD) was used to assess the effect of ELP on PE. Multiple regression analysis was performed on absolute PE versus axial length, corneal power, rate of refractive growth, refractive error, and best-corrected visual acuity.
Forty-three eyes were included. The PE was 0.63 ± 1.68 D; median absolute PE, 0.85 D (IQR, 1.83 D). The median absolute PE was greater when the measured ACD was used to calculate predicted refraction instead of the standard A-constant (1.88 D [IQR, 1.72] D vs 0.85 D [IQR, 1.83], resp. [P = 0.03]).

Monocular outcomes (right eyes) determined 1 and 3 months postoperatively were photopic corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), perceived halo, corrected intermediate-distance contrast sensitivity, and higher-order aberrations. The impact of the new IOL in the postoperative management with autorefraction devices was also evaluated.
No differences were found in CDVA between the two groups. Significant differences were detected between the two lenses evaluated in both total HOA (p = 0.028) and internal HOA (p = 0.037). Contrast sensitivity and halometry results obtained at 1 month were similar across the two IOL groups.

Prospective randomized controlled clinical study.
Patients aged 22 years or older with bilateral cataracts were randomized to receive bilateral implantation of DFT015 or SN60WF. The 4 coprimary effectiveness outcomes (6 months postoperatively) were monocular photopic distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA), monocular photopic corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), monocular depth of focus (DoF), and the percentage of patients achieving a DCIVA of 0.2 logMAR or better. The mean monocular photopic distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) was a secondary effectiveness outcome. Safety and patient-reported visual disturbances were evaluated through questionnaires.
218 patients (435 eyes) completed the study. Compared with SN60WF, DFT015 demonstrated superior mean monocular photopic DCIVA ( P &amp;lt; .001), noninferior mean monocular photopic CDVA, and superior mean monocular photopic DCNVA ( P &amp;lt; .001) and provided an extended monocular DoF (increase of 0.54 diopters at 0.2 logMAR).

Prospective, nonrandomized clinical study.
A total of 180 eyes of 180 patients (55 MFIOL, 60 monofocal intraocular lenses [MIOL], 65 phakic) with symptomatic vitreous opacities were enrolled. Vitreous structure was assessed with quantitative ultrasonography (QUS). Vision was evaluated with visual acuity and CSF measurements.
Vitreous echodensity was the same in all lens cohorts, yet CSF was worse in MFIOL eyes (P < .001). In 86 patients who elected vitrectomy, there was 68% greater vitreous echodensity and 31% worse CSF than in observation controls (P < .0001 for each). Preoperatively, CSF was 25% worse in MFIOL than in MIOL (P = .014). Postoperatively, vitreous echodensity decreased by 55%, 51%, and 52%, whereas CSF improved by 37% 48% in and 43% in MFIOL, MIOL, and phakic eyes, respectively (P < .0001 for each). NEI Visual Function Questionnaire analyses showed improved visual well-being.
Patients with vision degrading myodesopsia who elected vitrectomy had greater vitreous echodensity and worse CSF than controls, but no other differences in age, sex, or myopia. MFIOL eyes had worse CSF than MIOL and phakic eyes, very possibly due to combined effects of the MFIOL and vitreous opacification. Limited vitrectomy reduced vitreous echodensity and improved CSF in all eyes. All patients with CSF-degrading vitreous opacities benefited from limited vitrectomy, including those with MFIOL. As MFIOL eyes had 37% improvement in CSF, patients with MFIOL and vision degrading myodesopsia merit consideration of vitrectomy.";;;Vitreous echodensity was the same in all lens cohorts, yet CSF was worse in MFIOL eyes (P < .001).

Eyes were implanted from November 26, 2013, to December 1, 2017, with a custom, foldable artificial iris by 1 of 4 different surgical techniques. Patients were evaluated 1 day, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. At each examination, slit-lamp findings, intraocular pressure, implant position, subjective visual symptoms, and complications were recorded. Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and endothelial cell density (ECD) were measured at 3, 6, or 12 months as additional safety evaluations. The 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) was used to assess health-related quality of life affected by vision. The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale was used to assess cosmetic results.
Photosensitivity, glare, visual symptoms, NEI VFQ-25 score, Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale rating, prosthesis-related adverse events, intraocular lens (IOL)-related adverse events, and surgery-related adverse events 12 months after surgery.
At the 12-month postoperative examination, a 59.7% reduction in marked to severe daytime light sensitivity (P < 0.0001), a 41.5% reduction in marked to severe nighttime light sensitivity (P < 0.0001), a 53.1% reduction in marked to severe daytime glare (P < 0.0001), and a 48.5% reduction in severe nighttime glare (P < 0.0001) were found. A 15.4-point improvement (P < 0.0001) in the NEI VFQ-25 total score was found, and 93.8% of patients reported an improvement in cosmesis as measured by the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale 12 months after surgery.

Patients were examined before surgery and 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months after surgery. The main outcome measure was anterior chamber laser flare, measured with a laser flare meter as photon counts per millisecond (pc/ms).
Two weeks following surgery, median flare values were 28.9 pc/ms (range, 7.9-140) in the repositioning group and 31.6 pc/ms (range, 9.8-92.3) in the exchange group (P = .83). Flare levels were still elevated after 6 weeks with no difference between the groups (P = .93), whereas it decreased to baseline levels after 6 months.

Retrospective evaluation of a screening approach.
174 eyes (174 patients) that underwent ICL implantation were included. Patients were randomly assigned to the prediction equation group (116 eyes) or verification group (58 eyes). Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) (CASIA2 TOMEY) was performed before and 3 months after ICL surgery. For the prediction group, a prediction equation was created with the preoperative AS-OCT parameters and ICL size as independent variables and the postoperative anterior chamber depth (ACD) as the dependent variable. Then, by applying the predicted post-ACD and preoperative AS-OCT parameters as independent variables and TIA after ICL surgery as the dependent variable, a prediction equation was created to predict the postoperative TIA (post-TIA) after ICL surgery. Each prediction equation was created using stepwise multiple regression analysis, and its accuracy was verified by a Bland-Altman plot in the verification group.
The explanatory variables (standardized partial regression coefficient) selected in the post-TIA prediction equation were post-ACD (0.629), TIA750 (0.563), iris curvature (0.353), pupil diameter (-0.281), iris area (-0.249), and trabecular iris space area 250 (-0.171) (R2 = 0.646) (n = 116).

85 eyes were randomized to group 1 (Vivinex XY1) and group 2 (AcrySof IQ) with 40 and 45 eyes, respectively. The higher-order aberration (HOA) profile, Strehl ratio, decentration of the IOL from the visual axis (decentration from the visual axis [DVA]) and the geometric axis (decentration from the geometric axis [DGA]), angle α, and κ were recorded on the iTrace aberrometer, and contrast sensitivity was measured using the Functional Acuity Contrast Test at 12 weeks postsurgery.
A total of 85 eyes in 60 patients were evaluated in this study. The mean values of the Strehl ratio (P = .48) and the HOAs (P = .12) of both IOLs were comparable. The HOAs gradually increased with increasing DVA for both lenses at 3.0 mm, 4.0 mm, and 5.0 mm pupil sizes. On comparing the HOAs with the DGA, a statistically insignificant positive correlation was observed. The Strehl ratio did not deteriorate with an increasing angle α in the Vivinex XY1 group; however, it worsened in the AcrySof IQ group. Contrast sensitivity was comparable in both the IOLs except at 1.5 cycles per degree under photopic conditions where the AcrySof IQ was better.

The David J. Apple Center for Vision Research, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.
Prospective, randomized, comparative study with laboratory investigation.
Implantation videos and postuse injectors from 60 paired eyes of 30 bilateral cataract patients were included. Patient eyes were randomly assigned for implantation with 2 different preloaded injectors: the AutonoMe with a Clareon IOL (Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) and the iSert with a Vivinex IOL (Hoya Corp.). Videos were reviewed for events during the implantation procedure, and the duration of each step of implantation. Injector nozzles were examined under light and scanning electron microscopy. Damage was graded and correlated with the IOL power. Three months postoperatively IOLs were assessed for material changes.
IOL delivery was without any critical events in 60 of the 60 eyes. The implantation took 56 seconds with the AutonoMe and 44 seconds with the iSert (P < .05). Most AutonoMe injectors (29; 97%) showed no damage or slight deformation. In most of the iSert injectors (25; 80%), short or extended cracks were present, and damage lengths correlated with the IOL power. All IOLs were free of material changes, including glistenings, 3 months postoperatively.
Both preloaded IOL injectors allowed a safe and convenient IOL delivery. Implantation of the Clareon IOL took, on average, slightly longer than that of the Vivinex IOL, mostly due to a slower IOL unfolding.

A prospective, single-center, open label, randomized, two-arm study was designed. Cataract patients with corneal astigmatism of 1.0-2.0D were enrolled and divided into test and control groups. The test group had the AcrySof® IQ Toric IOL implanted and the control group had the AcrySof® IQ IOL implanted with a steep-axis corneal incision. All patients underwent examinations of uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), subjective refraction, and corneal astigmatism before surgery and at the 1-day, 1-month, and 3-month follow-ups. Vector astigmatism analysis was evaluated using the Alpins method.
We enrolled 26 eyes of 20 patients in the study, with 13 eyes in each group. The test group had better vision than the control group at the 3-month follow-up and had more cases with a UCDVA of 20/20 (10/13 vs. 4/13).

37;33567018;Influence of pupillary dynamics on the defocus curve of eyes implanted with diffractive multifocal lenses: a randomized study.;[];Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia;"To evaluate the influence of pupil dynamics on the defocus profile and area-of-focus of eyes implanted with a diffractive multifocal intraocular lens (IOL).
This prospective randomized trial was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo, Brazil. Thirty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive the multifocal SN6AD1 (n=20) or the aspheric monofocal SN60WF (aIOL) (n=18) IOLs bilaterally. Dynamic pupillometry, visual acuity for distance and near, corrected and uncorrected, and a defocus profile were assessed postoperatively. The area-of-focus was calculated using an empirical polynomial model of the defocus profile.
Sixteen patients (32 eyes) in the multifocal SN6AD1 group and 17 patients (34 eyes) in the aspheric monofocal SN60WF group completed the 1-year follow-up. There were no significant between-group differences in monocular uncorrected distance or near visual acuity. The defocus profiles of the mfIOL group showed a double peak, whereas those of the aspheric monofocal SN60WF group showed only one peak, which is typical for a monofocal intraocular lens. The area-of-focus of the aIOL group (4.66 ± 1.51 logMARxD) was significantly different from that of the multifocal SN6AD1 (1.99 ± 1.31 logMARxD). Pupil size at maximum contraction after exposure to a flash of 30 cd/m2 for 1 second was significantly correlated with a better area-of-focus in the multifocal SN6AD1 group (r=0.54; p=0.0017), whereas this was not the case in the aspheric monofocal SN60WF group.
These findings indicate that in eyes implanted with an multifocal SN6AD1, the smaller the pupil size, the better is the area-of-focus and hence the better is the visual performance.

This prospective study was performed on 75 eyes of 75 patients who underwent uneventful cataract surgery. Preoperative ocular parameters including axial length (AL), keratometry (K), anterior chamber depth (ACD), corneal astigmatism, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) examined at the two time points, more than 3 months preoperatively and preoperative 1 day were compared. The ocular parameters measured in the two time points were used to calculate the predicted implanted IOL power and the actual IOL power was chosen on the basis of parameters measured earlier before surgery using the Haigis formula. The mean numerical error (MNE) and mean absolute error (MAE) predicted by the two time points were also compared.
There were significant differences in the ACD, IOL power, UDVA and CDVA (P<0.01), but no statistical differences in AL, mean K and corneal astigmatism (P>0.05) during the average of 5.6 months before surgery.

This prospective, interventional, non-randomized comparison study included eligible patients who underwent toric phakic IOL surgery in one or both eyes with either the EP TIOL or TICL for myopic astigmatism. Two years postoperatively, both lenses were compared for their safety, efficacy, stability, and patient satisfaction. Vector analysis of astigmatism was performed using the Alpins method with the ASSORT software (ASSORT Party Ltd).
A total of 50 eyes were included, of which 25 eyes received EP TIOL implantation and the remaining 25 received TICL implantation. Preoperative mean ± standard deviation of spherical equivalent (SE) and cylinder was -10.15 ± 4.04 and -2.08 ± 0.86 diopters (D) in the EP TIOL group and -10.21 ± 3.97 and -2.17 ± 0.95 D in the TICL group, respectively. At 2 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference between the mean uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, spherical equivalent, and residual astigmatism between the two groups (P > .05 for all parameters). Ninety-two percent of eyes in the EP TIOL group and 88% of eyes in the TICL group were within ±0.50 D of refractive astigmatism. Vector analysis of astigmatism showed a comparable Correction Index of 0.98 in the EP TIOL group and 0.94 in the TICL group, signifying a mild undercorrection of 2% and 6%, respectively. Two eyes in the TICL group underwent exchange for high vault and one eye required realignment due to significant postoperative rotation.

42;33413210;Effect of capsular tension ring implantation on capsular stability after phacoemulsification in patients with weak zonules: a randomized controlled trial. CTR implantation in cataract patients with weak zonules.;['Capsular tension ring', 'Cataract', 'Pars plana vitrectomy', 'Phacoemulsification', 'Severe myopia', 'Weak zonules'];BMC ophthalmology;"The use of capsular tension ring (CTR) implantation to treat cataract patients with weak zonules is still controversial. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of CTR implantation on capsular stability after phacoemulsification in patients with weak zonules, especially patients who have undergone pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) or those who suffer from severe myopia.
A total of 42 patients who underwent phacoemulsification and received an intraocular lens (IOL) were randomized to undergo CTR implantation or not. The control and CTR groups were compared in terms of uncorrected distant visual acuity (UDVA), best corrected distant visual acuity (BCDVA), refractive prediction error, the area of anterior capsulorhexis, and IOL inclination angle. Follow-up visits were conducted postoperatively at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 3 months. Subgroup analyses were performed based on PPV and severe myopia.
Surgery significantly improved UDVA and BCDVA to similar extents in CTR and control patients, and refraction prediction error was similar between the two groups at all follow-up times. At 3 months after surgery, the area of anterior capsulorhexis was significantly larger in CTR patients than in controls (p = 0.0199). These differences were also significant between the subgroups of patients with severe myopia. Vertical IOL inclination was less within CTR groups at 3 months after surgery, especially in patients with severe myopia (p = 0.0286). At 1 week postoperatively, the proportion of individuals whose posterior lens capsule that had completely adhered to the posterior IOL surface was significantly higher among CTR patients (p = 0.023). No serious surgical complications were observed.
CTR implantation can benefit cataract patients with weak zonules by maintaining the shape of the capsular bag, reducing capsule shrinkage and stabilizing IOL inclination.

To identify and characterize incident cases of glaucoma and glaucoma-related adverse events (glaucoma + glaucoma suspect) among children in the Infant Aphakia Treatment Study (IATS) by the age of 10.5 years and to determine whether these diagnoses are associated with optic nerve head (ONH) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) assessment.
Analysis of a multicenter randomized clinical trial of 114 infants with unilateral congenital cataract who were aged 1 to 6 months at surgery. Data on long-term glaucoma-related status and outcomes were collected when children were 10.5 years old (July 14, 2015, to July 12, 2019) and analyzed from March 30, 2019, to August 6, 2019.
Participants were randomized at cataract surgery to either primary intraocular lens (IOL), or aphakia (contact lens [CL]). Standardized definitions of glaucoma and glaucoma suspect were created for IATS and applied for surveillance and diagnosis.
Development of glaucoma and glaucoma + glaucoma suspect in operated-on eyes up to age 10.5 years, plus intraocular pressure, axial length, RNFL (by optical coherence tomography), and ONH photographs.
In Kaplan-Meier analysis, for all study eyes combined (n = 114), risk of glaucoma after cataract removal rose from 9% (95% CI, 5%-16%) at 1 year, to 17% (95% CI, 11%-25%) at 5 years, to 22% (95% CI, 16%-31%) at 10 years. The risk of glaucoma plus  glaucoma suspect diagnosis after cataract removal rose from 12% (95% CI, 7%-20%) at 1 year, to 31% (95% CI, 24%-41%) at 5 years, to 40% (95% CI, 32%-50%) at 10 years. Risk of glaucoma and glaucoma plus glaucoma suspect diagnosis at 10 years was not significantly different between treatment groups. Eyes with glaucoma (compared with eyes with glaucoma suspect or neither) had longer axial length but relatively preserved RNFL and similar ONH appearance and visual acuity at age 10 years.
Risk of glaucoma-related adverse events continues to increase with longer follow-up of children following unilateral cataract removal in infancy and is not associated with primary IOL implantation. Development of glaucoma (or glaucoma suspect) after removal of unilateral congenital cataract was not associated with worse visual acuity outcomes at 10 years.

However, the crossed monovision, which is to correct the dominant eye for near vision and the non-dominant eye for distant vision, has been mentioned preferable for high myopic cataract patients by some studies. We have conducted this study to compare clinical results to assess the feasibility of conventional and crossed monovision for high myopic pseudophakic patients by comparing patient satisfaction, visual function and spectacle independence.
Forty-sixth high myopia patients were divided into two groups: 22 in crossed monovision group with patients whose refraction targeted to - 2.00 diopters (D) in the dominant eye and - 0.50D in the non-dominant eye; 24 in conventional monovision group with patients whose refraction targeted to - 0.50D in the dominant eye and - 2.00D in the non-dominant eye. Binocular uncorrected distance visual acuity (BUDVA), binocular uncorrected near visual acuity (BUNVA), binocular corrected distant visual acuity (BCDVA), binocular corrected near visual acuity (BCNVA), contrast visual acuity and stereoacuity were examined at postoperative 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months. Questionnaires were completed by patients 3 months after binocular surgery to evaluate patients' satisfaction and spectacle independence.
The conventional monovision and the crossed monovision group showed no significant differences of mean BUDVA, BUNVA, BCDVA, BCNVA 2 weeks, 1 month or 3 months postoperatively (P > 0.05). There was no difference in the bilateral contrast sensitivity or stereoscopic function between the convention conventional and crossed monovision groups (P > 0.05). Patient satisfaction with near and distant vision, as well as spectacle dependence did not differ significantly between the two groups (P > 0.05).
Crossed pseudophakic monovision exhibited similar visual function when compared with conventional monovision technique, which indicates that it is an effective option to improve the visual functionality and quality of life for high myopic patients who considering bilateral cataract surgery.

Patients with aphakic or complicated pseudophakic bullous keratopathy visiting a tertiary eyecare center were included in the study. A total of 40 patients were randomized into 2 groups of 20 each. Group 1 had subjects who underwent scleral-fixated IOL (SF IOL) implantation by intrascleral haptic fixation technique, followed by DSAEK (sequential procedure) with an interval of at least 3 months. Group 2 (simultaneous) had subjects who underwent DSAEK with SF IOL as a combined procedure. Graft survival, endothelial cell loss (ECL), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), and need for any intervention such as rebubbling were evaluated for both the groups at the end of 6 months.
At 6 months, the sequential group had significantly better CDVA of 0.62 ± 0.17 logMAR compared with 0.87 ± 0.19 logMAR in the simultaneous group (P = .002).

Food and Drug Administration-approved, prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, parallel-group, assessor-masked, confirmatory trial.
Patients enrolled were 22 years of age or older with a diagnosis of bilateral cataract with planned removal by phacoemulsification with a clear corneal incision.
Consented participants selected their preferred IOL, which was implanted sequentially into each eye of patients meeting eligibility criteria.
The coprimary effectiveness outcomes were mean photopic monocular best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA; 4 m) and distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA; 40 cm) at 6 months after surgery. Secondary effectiveness outcomes included mean monocular distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA; 66 cm) and proportion of participants responding ""never"" to question 1 of the Intraocular Lens Satisfaction questionnaire (regarding frequency of spectacle use in the past 7 days). Safety outcomes included frequency of ""severe"" and ""most bothersome"" visual disturbances.
Two hundred forty-three patients underwent cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of the TFNT00 (n = 129) or SN60AT (n = 114) and were followed up for 6 months. Noninferiority of TFNT00 to SN60AT in mean photopic monocular BCDVA (95% upper confidence limit of the difference was <0.1 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] margin), and superiority in mean photopic monocular DCNVA (difference of 0.42 logMAR; P < 0.001) and DCIVA (difference of 0.26 logMAR; P < 0.001) were demonstrated. The proportion of patients never requiring glasses overall was superior for TFNT00 versus SN60AT (80.5% and 8.2%, respectively).

The study included 114 infants, 57 in the aphakic group and 57 in the primary IOL group; 55 of 57 patients randomized to aphakia with contact lens correction were seen for the 10½-year study visit; 24 (44%) of 55 eyes had secondary IOL surgery. Median age at IOL surgery was 5.4 years (range 1.7 to 10.3 years). Mean absolute prediction error was 1.00 ± 0.70 diopters (D). At age 10½ years, the median logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity (VA) was 0.9 (range 0.2 to 1.7), similar to VA in the 31 eyes still aphakic (0.8, range 0.1 to 2.9); the number of eyes with stable or improved VA scores between the 4½-year and 10½-year study visits was also similar (78% secondary IOL eyes; 84% aphakic eyes). For eyes undergoing IOL implantation after the 4½-year study visit (n = 22), the mean refraction at age 10½ years was -3.20 ± 2.70 D (range -9.90 to 1.10 D), compared with -5.50 ± 6.60 D (n = 53, range -26.50 to 3.00 D) in eyes with primary IOL (P = .03).

The aim of this prospective multi-centre randomised trial was to compare two EDOF IOLs and one monofocal IOL.
Cataract patients between 50 and 80 years were randomised for bilateral implantation with either the AT LARA 829MP (EDOF), the TECNIS Symfony (EDOF) or the CT ASPHINA 409MP (monofocal). Follow-up was at 1 to 2 weeks, 1 month and 4 to 6 months.
A total of 211 patients were randomised and included in the final analysis. Monocular depth of focus was significantly better for AT LARA 829MP eyes compared with that for TECNIS Symfony at all thresholds (p = 0.024, 0.001 and 0.006, for 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 logMAR respectively) with no significant difference for binocular depth of focus. LARA eyes had significantly better monocular depth of focus at all levels compared with ASPHINA eyes (all p < 0.0001), while there was no significant difference between Symfony and ASPHINA eyes at 0.1 logMAR and 0.2 logMAR. Both EDOF IOLs were significantly better than the monofocal ASPHINA at all levels for binocular depth of focus (LARA: all p < 0.0001; Symfony: all p = 0.002). Distance visual acuity was similar for all IOLs at 6 months; intermediate and near visual acuity were significantly better for the EDOF IOLs than for the monofocal (p < 0.0001). Refraction improved in all groups relative to baseline. Contrast sensitivity was higher with the CT ASPHINA 409MP but both EDOF lenses had a better spectacle independence rate. At 6 months, all IOLs were well centred with no cases of tilt. No general safety issues were raised for any of the groups.
The two EDOF intraocular lenses investigated provided good visual outcomes with comparable visual acuity at all distances. The AT LARA 829MP provided the widest monocular depth of focus at 0.1 and 0.2 logMAR, with a clear superiority compared with the monofocal IOL.

A prospective, randomized, contralateral eye study was performed at one site in Poughkeepsie, NY, USA. Subjects included patients presenting for uncomplicated bilateral cataract surgery eligible for toric lens implantation with regular corneal astigmatism in both eyes whose toric IOL implantation was based on IA. One eye was measured when aphakic and the other when both aphakic and pseudophakic. The primary outcome measure was the magnitude of residual refractive astigmatism. Secondary measures included the percentage of eyes with 0.50D or less of residual refractive astigmatism, the spherical equivalent refraction and the time for IA measurement.
Mean residual refractive astigmatism was not statistically significantly different between groups (0.32D ± 0.46D IA_1 vs. 0.23D ± 0.35D IA_2, p = 0.25), nor was the percentage of eyes with a residual refractive cylinder of 0.50D or less (94% in both groups, p = 1.0). The average time to measure the pseudophakic eye was 3 min, 46 s. Aphakic IA measurements appeared to produce better spherical equivalent refractive results relative to preoperative calculations.

60;32728226;A randomised, prospective study of 'off-the-shelf' use of toric intraocular lenses for cataract patients with pre-existing corneal astigmatism in the NHS.;[];Eye (London, England);"To compare visual and refractive outcomes of monofocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) with limbal relaxing incisions (LRI) with 'off-the-shelf' use of toric IOLs (TIOLs), with a fixed 2-dioptre cylinder (DC) correction, for cataract patients with pre-existing corneal astigmatism in a public-sector setting.
Seventy-seven patients (77 eyes, first treated eye) with visually significant cataract and pre-operative corneal astigmatism ≥2.00 DC were randomised to receive either 'off-the-shelf' TIOLs, with a fixed 2.00 DC cylinder correction (39 eyes), or monofocal IOLs (38 eyes) with LRIs. The concept of fixing the cylindrical correction was to minimise costs, allow a full TIOL bank to be available and eliminate the need for individual TIOL ordering. Outcome measures were uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and refraction. Astigmatic changes were evaluated using the Alpins vector method.
Mean UDVA improved from logMAR 0.88 (SD 0.56)[~20/150] pre-operatively to 0.18 (SD 0.19)[~20/30] post-operatively in TIOL group, versus 0.82 (SD 0.55)[~20/130] to 0.27 (SD 0.15)[~20/40] in monofocal/LRI group (P = 0.02; 95% CI: -0.17, -0.01). Mean CDVA improved from logMAR 0.40 (SD 0.26)[~20/50] to 0.01 (SD 0.12)[~20/20] in TIOL group, and 0.41 (SD 0.38)[~20/40] to 0.06 (SD 0.12)[~20/25] in LRI group (P = 0.07; 95% CI: -0.11, 0.01). Average post-operative refractive cylinder in TIOL group was 1.35 DC (SD 0.84 DC) and in LRI group 1.91 DC (SD 1.07 DC) (P = 0.01; 95% CI: -1, -0.12). Mean difference vector magnitude was 1.92 DC (SD 1.08 DC) in LRI group and 1.37 DC (SD 0.84 DC) in TIOL group (P = 0.02; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.99).

Prospective comparative interventional study.
This multicenter study population included 1 eye of both 930 cataract patients with and 470 cataract patients without uncomplicated PEX (no small pupils or phacodonesis) all undergoing phacoemulsification by experienced Aravind Eye Care System surgeons. Eyes were randomized to either 1- or 3-piece intraocular lenses (IOLs). PEX eyes were also randomized to either receive or not receive a capsule tension ring. The main outcome measures included IOL decentration and PCO. Secondary outcomes included postoperative best-corrected VA.

Prospective, randomized, double-masked clinical trial.
One hundred patients were randomized for bilateral implantation of either a Bi-Flex 677MY mIOL or a Bi-Flex 677AB IOL and were assessed at 3 to 6 months (V1) and 12 to 18 months (V2). Primary outcomes included distance, intermediate, and near logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuities (VAs) and defocus curve profile assessment. Secondary outcomes included reading speed, contrast sensitivity (CS), and the subjective perception of quality of vision.

Oslo University Hospital, Norway.
Prospective, parallel group, randomized clinical trial.
During a 3-year period, 104 patients were randomly assigned to groups receiving either IOL exchange with retropupillary fixation of an iris-claw IOL (n = 50) or IOL repositioning by scleral suturing (n = 54). All operations were performed by 1 surgeon with an anterior approach. Endothelial cell density (ECD) and central corneal thickness were measured preoperatively and at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. A linear mixed model was applied for the longitudinal analysis, where patients with at least 1 ECD measurement were included (n = 44 exchange; n = 50 repositioning). The main outcome measure was 2-year longitudinal ECL in IOL exchange compared with IOL repositioning.

Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.
Single-center, single-masked, prospective, randomized controlled trial.
One hundred thirty-nine patients with bilateral cataracts were randomized to receive the Clareon (C IOL) or Tecnis (T IOL) IOL. Visual acuity, refraction, central corneal thickness (CCT), endothelial cell loss, contrast sensitivity, mesopic gap acuity, evaluation of glistenings, and rates of perioperative and postoperative complications were recorded. Quality-of-life outcomes were measured with the EuroQOL-5 dimensions questionnaire and the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) questionnaire. Optimized A-constants were available for the T IOL but not for the C IOL.
Seventy-one patients (140 eyes) received the C IOLs and 68 patients (134 eyes) received the T IOLs. Data were analyzed for the first implanted eye. At 12 months, mean uncorrected distance visual acuity (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) was 0.02 ± 0.10 and 0.01 ± 0.08 (mean ± SD; P = .49; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.04) in the C IOL and T IOL groups, respectively. Corrected distance visual acuity was -0.02 ± 0.09 and -0.03 ± 0.06, respectively (P = .45; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.04). The increase in CCT was 14 ± 19 and 16 ± 28 μm, respectively (P = .63; 95% CI, -10.16 to 6.16).

74;32126028;Pure phaco: phacoemulsification without ophthalmic viscosurgical devices.;[];Journal of cataract and refractive surgery;The ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD) is an essential part of modern phacoemulsification surgery. Many times, OVDs are blamed for intraocular pressure spikes, toxic anterior segment syndrome, and capsular bag distension syndrome. To avoid these complications, we developed a technique in which phacoemulsification can be done without using OVDs. The irrigating cannula, on a continuous irrigation mode, was introduced through a side port, and capsulorhexis and incision construction were performed under an irrigating balanced salt solution. No hydroprocedure was performed. Phacoemulsification was done by chopping technique. At the end of the procedure, the intraocular lens was implanted by wound assistance technique under a continuous irrigation mode.;;;;;10.1097/j.jcrs.0000000000000054;2020-03-04;[{'lastname': 'Bardoloi', 'firstname': 'Narayan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'From the Chandraprabha Eye Hospital, Jorhat, Assam, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Sarkar', 'firstname': 'Sandip', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pilania', 'firstname': 'Ashu', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Das', 'firstname': 'Himangshu', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}]
75;32092103;Effects of capsular tension ring on surgical outcomes of premium intraocular lens in patients with suspected zonular weakness.;[];PloS one;"To assess the influence of capsular tension ring (CTR) on surgical outcomes of toric and multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) in eyes at high risk of zonular instability.
Fifty-five eyes of 43 patients who had undergone phacoemulsification and IOL implantation were included in the analysis. They had some risk of zonular weakness, such as pseudoexfoliation, shallow anterior chamber, high myopia, and phacodonesis, or were judged to have unstable zonules during surgery. Toric IOL was implanted in 9 eyes with CTR and 22 eyes without CTR, while multifocal IOL was used in 9 eyes with CTR and 15 eyes without CTR. Manifest refraction, refractive astigmatism, visual acuity, and degree of IOL decentration and tilt measured using swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography were analyzed. Axis misalignment of toric IOLs were also evaluated.
In toric IOLs, co-implantation of CTR significantly reduced decentration and axis misalignment of IOL, resulting in better uncorrected and corrected visual acuity after surgery. In multifocal IOLs, combined use of CTR significantly prevented IOL tilt, leading to better intermediate visual acuity. Spherical equivalent and residual astigmatism were not significantly affected by the use of CTR.

76;32077909;Long-term Effect of Intraocular Lens vs Contact Lens Correction on Visual Acuity After Cataract Surgery During Infancy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.;[];JAMA ophthalmology;"Although intraocular lenses (IOLs) are often implanted in children, little is known whether primary IOL implantation or aphakia and contact lens correction results in better long-term visual outcomes after unilateral cataract surgery during infancy.
To compare long-term visual outcomes with contact lens vs IOL correction following unilateral cataract surgery during infancy.
This multicenter randomized clinical trial enrolled 114 infants with a unilateral congenital cataract who underwent cataract surgery with or without primary IOL implantation between 1 and 6 months of age. Data on long-term visual outcomes were collected when the children were age 10.5 years (July 14, 2015, to July 12, 2019) and analyzed from March 30 through August 6, 2019.
Intraocular lens implantation at the time of cataract surgery.
Best-corrected visual acuity using the electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (E-ETDRS) testing protocol. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.
Best-corrected visual acuity was measured at age 10.5 years for 110 of the 114 patients (96%) enrolled as infants. The participants included 58 girls (53%) and 52 boys (47%). Overall, 27 of the children (25%) had good (logMAR 0.30 [Snellen equivalent, 20/40] or better) visual acuity in the treated eye (12 [22%] in the IOL group and 15 [27%] in the aphakia group), but 50 children (44%) had a visual acuity of logMAR 1.00 (Snellen equivalent, 20/200) or worse (25 [44%] in the IOL group and 25 [44%] in the aphakia group). The median logMAR acuity in the treated eye was similar in children randomized to receive an IOL at the time of cataract extraction (0.89; interquartile range [IQR], 0.33-1.43 [Snellen equivalent, 20/159]) and those who remained aphakic (0.86; IQR, 0.30-1.46 [Snellen equivalent, 20/145]) (IQR, 0.30-1.46; P = .82). Although the overall difference in median visual acuity between the 2 groups was small, the estimate was imprecise (99% CI for the difference in medians was -0.54 to 0.47).
As in previous phases of the study, visual acuity outcomes were highly variable with only 27 children (25%) achieving excellent visual acuity in their treated eye and 50 children (44%) having poor vision in the treated eye. Implanting an IOL at the time of cataract extraction was neither beneficial nor detrimental to the visual outcome.

Single-centre prospective double-masked randomized controlled trial. 220 eyes of 201 participants undergoing routine cataract surgery were randomized to receive their intraocular lens either orientated with the optic-haptic junctions at 180° ('horizontal') or without manipulation following implantation (control). Patients were excluded according to age (<19 and > 99 years), coexisting eye disease affecting visual function and insufficient cognitive function to complete the study. In the fourth postoperative week, a telephone interview was conducted to determine rates of negative dysphotopsia. The data were analysed to provide the relative risk of negative dysphotopsia with horizontal orientation of the intraocular lens (IOL) optic-haptic junctions compared with standard treatment.
Orientating the IOL optic-haptic junctions horizontally halved the incidence of pseudophakic negative dysphotopsia in the fourth postoperative week (9/110 in the intervention group; 18/110 in the control group; RR: 0.50, 95% confidence interval: 0.235-1.064, p = 0.072). The overall incidence of negative dysphotopsia was 12.2% (27/220 participating eyes). No intraoperative adverse effects of intraocular lens rotation were reported.

78;32005971;Effectiveness of intraoperative intraocular lens use on improving surgical safety for dense cataract phacoemulsification: a randomized controlled trial.;[];Scientific reports;We designed this study to assess if surgical safety can be improved by intraoperative use of intraocular lens (IOL) for cataract phacoemulsification. We performed phacoemulsification cataract removal on 401 patients. We randomly assigned these patients into three groups: the standard setting (Group I, n = 134), with reduced vacuum and flow rate (Group II, n = 137), and with IOL insertion before the last quadrant was emulsified with standard setting (Group III, n = 130). The primary outcomes included the risk of posterior capsular rupture (PCR), ultrasound time, energy, and complications. The secondary outcomes included central corneal thickness (CCT), CCT changes, endothelial cells (ETC) counting, ETC loss, and the best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA) measured on day 1, day 7 and day 30. If PCR occurred, we emulsified the residual lens materials after insertion of IOL and clean of the prolapsed vitreous. We found that the risk of PCR in Group III (0/130) was lower than Group I (9/134, corrected relative risk (RR) = 18.44, 95% CI: 1.08-313.56) and Group II (3/137, corrected RR = 6.64, 95% CI: 0.35-27.41). Group III showed better BCVA on day 1 and 7, less ECC loss on day 7 and 30, and less CCT increase on day 1 and 7. No cases converted to extracapsular cataract extraction. No residual lens materials misdirected into vitreous cavity. Intraoperative use of IOL can improve surgical safety for dense cataract phacoemulsification.;;;;;"10.1038/s41598-020-58597-0

One hundred and thirty-five eyes of 68 patients (19 men, 49 women; mean age, 66.3 ± 7.4 years) were followed for 6 months. Trifocal IOLs with focal points at near, intermediate, and distance were implanted bilaterally in eyes with less than 1 diopter of corneal astigmatism. The visual acuity (VA) at distance, 60 and 40 centimeters (cm), and contrast sensitivities were measured. Patients completed quality-of-life questionnaires preoperatively and postoperatively.
The mean bilateral logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution VA at 5 meters (m), 60 cm, and 40 cm were, respectively: uncorrected, - 0.104 ± 0.095, - 0.065 ± 0.111, and - 0.042 ± 0.105; and distance-corrected, - 0.197 ± 0.076, - 0.112 ± 0.111, and - 0.073 ± 0.111.

Seventy-nine eyes of 79 patients who underwent uneventful cataract surgery were enrolled. For crystalline lens preoperative anterior segment data, the LT, and anterior, equatorial, and posterior surface depths (ASD, ESD, and PSD, respectively) of crystalline lenses were quantitatively determined. For postoperative anterior segment data, the actual IOL position was quantified. Moreover, the following correlations were analyzed: LT with the ASD, ESD, PSD, and IOL position; IOL position with the ASD, ESD, and PSD; and refractive prediction error with the difference between the predicted postoperative anterior chamber depth (ACD) of the SRK/T formula and the IOL position, ASD, ESD, and PSD (each depth minus the predicted postoperative ACD of the SRK/T formula).
The LT was significantly correlated with the ASD (r = -0.65) and PSD (r = 0.41), whereas it was not correlated with the ESD or IOL position. The IOL position was significantly correlated with the ASD (r = 0.67), ESD (r = 0.72), and PSD (r = 0.74).

Patients were evaluated preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively for monocular and binocular uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity, intermediate and near visual acuities, the binocular defocus curve, and manifest refraction. Dysphotopic phenomena were objectively evaluated and subjective patient satisfaction questionnaires administered.
The study included 42 patients (84 eyes). The mean postoperative spherical equivalent was -0.06 D ± 0.57 (SD). The binocular visual acuities were 0.00 ± 0.05 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) (UDVA), 0.19 ± 0.11 logMAR (uncorrected intermediate visual acuity at 80 cm), 0.16 ± 0.10 logMAR (distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity at 80 cm), 0.11 ± 0.09 logMAR (uncorrected near visual acuity at 40 cm), and 0.08 ± 0.09 logMAR (distance-corrected near visual acuity at 40 cm). The binocular defocus curve showed a visual acuity of 0.20 logMAR or better between +0.50 D and -3.00 D. Of the patients, 92%, 92%, and 75% reported never wearing spectacles for distance, intermediate, or near distance, respectively.

In this randomized clinical trial, 104 patients were randomly assigned to IOL repositioning by scleral suturing (n = 54) or IOL exchange with a retropupillary iris-claw lens (n = 50). A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was performed in conjunction with previously published 6-month efficacy and safety results. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated as the cost difference between the operation groups relative to their difference in postoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) (mean and 95% confidence interval: minimum and maximum), reported as the cost difference in United States Dollars ($) per logMAR difference.
Exchange surgery was $281.20 ± 17.66 more expensive than repositioning, mainly explained by the new IOL and the frequent use of anterior vitrectomy. A previous trial publication revealed no significant difference in the 6-month postoperative CDVA between the groups. In the CEA, the mean group difference yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -$281.20 per -0.11 logMAR (-$1108/QALY) in favour of repositioning, ranging from -$281.20 per -0.29 logMAR (-$406/QALY) in favour of repositioning to +$281.20 per -0.08 logMAR (+$1522/QALY) in favour of exchange.

Thirty eyes of children with insufficient capsular support for IOL implantation were randomized to undergo sutureless transscleral IOL fixation or iris-claw lens fixation. The primary outcome was best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Secondary outcomes included operative time, astigmatism, central corneal thickness, endothelial cell count (ECC), IOL decentration and tilt, central foveal thickness and complications.
There was a significant improvement in BCVA at all follow-up visits, with no significant difference between both groups. 53.3% in the transscleral-fixated IOL group and 80% in the iris-claw IOL group had a final BCVA ≥0.3. The operative time was significantly shorter in the iris-claw IOL group (p = 0.001). IOL decentration and tilt were higher in the transscleral-fixated IOL group, but the difference was not significant. The ECC was reduced by 14.6% in the transscleral-fixated IOL group and 11% in the iris-claw group at 6 months, with no significant difference between both groups (p = 0.5). In the transscleral-fixated IOL group, two eyes developed ocular hypertension and two eyes had IOL decentration, while in the iris-claw IOL group, 1 eye developed glaucoma, three eyes had haptic disenclavation, and one eye had retinal detachment.

All patients undergoing phacoemulsification received intraocular lens based on the voluntary principle. Forty eyes were implanted with the C-loop haptic intraocular lens (AMO Tecnis ZCB00) while the other 40 eyes were implanted with the plate haptic intraocular lens (CT ASPHINA 509 M).

The lenses' rotational stability and centration were measured by means of the PIOLET software, which relies on recording and image processing techniques to determine lens rotation and centration based on slit-lamp images. We also assessed patients' visual quality by means of 25, 40, and 80 cm VA tests.
The best centration results were achieved with the POD Toric FineVision model, although the differences were not statistically significant. As for lens rotation, it was below 5° in all cases under study. Regarding VA, all subjects attained at least 0.3 logMAR for far distance uncorrected VA, at 80 cm VA was about 0.2 logMAR, at 40 cm it was above 0.15 logMAR, and at 25 cm it was about 0.3 logMAR for both lens types.
All three intraocular lens models yield excellent visual results at far, near as well as intermediate distances. The POD FineVision and POD Toric FineVision models, with double C-loop design, yielded the best results centration-wise and rotation-wise. Differences had no clinical relevance.";All three intraocular lens models yield excellent visual results at far, near as well as intermediate distances.

119;30190562;Posterior Chamber Phakic Intraocular Lens Implantation in Eyes with an Anterior Chamber Depth of Less Than 3 mm: A Multicenter Study.;[];Scientific reports;"This study was aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of Visian ICL (hole ICL; STAAR Surgical, Inc.) implantation for the correction of myopic refractive errors in eyes having an anterior chamber depth (ACD) below the current manufacturer's recommendation (<3.0 mm). We comprised 365 eyes of 201 consecutive patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 35.7 ± 7.5 years) with spherical equivalents of -8.66 ± 3.54 D. We evaluated the safety, efficacy, predictability, stability, intraocular pressure (IOP), endothelial cell density (ECD), and complications. The safety and efficacy indices were 1.12 ± 0.22 and 0.98 ± 0.22. At 1 year, 90% and 98% of eyes were within ± 0.5 and 1.0 D of the attempted correction, respectively. Changes in the manifest refraction from 1 week to 1 year postoperatively were -0.08 ± 0.34 D. The mean ECD loss was 0.2 ± 8.7%. No eyes showed a significant ECD loss (≥30%). We found no significant correlation between the ACD and the change in ECD (Pearson correlation coefficient r = -0.048, p = 0.360). No significant IOP rise or vision-threatening complication occurred at any time. These findings indicate that the surgical indication of ICL implantation should be reconsidered in terms of ACD.";;;;;"10.1038/s41598-018-31782-y

In Group A, the IOL was designed according to preoperative calculation of the corneal spherical aberration Z(4,0). The aim was to achieve an overall postoperative ocular spherical aberration close to zero. Four weeks and 3 months postoperatively, the refraction, visual acuity (far, intermediate, and near distance), photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivities (with and without glare), defocus curve, corneal and ocular spherical aberration, and pupil size were measured.

The percentages of eyes with refractive prediction error within ±0.50 D at one month after surgery were compared. To evaluate the effect of the dioptric errors of the IOL itself on refractive prediction error, the percentage of eyes with refractive prediction error within ±0.25 D of the IOL with a standard deviation (SD) of ±0.40 D was compared with that of the IOL with a SD of ±0.11 D through Monte Carlo simulations.

Thus, we evaluated decentration and tilt of single- and three-piece IOLs, as well as anterior chamber depth (ACD), at 3 hours, 24 hours, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after cataract surgery, using swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography. There was no significant difference in postoperative visual acuity between eyes with single- or three-piece IOLs. Absolute values of IOL decentration at 24 hours and 2 weeks after surgery were significantly larger (P = 0.008 and 0.046, respectively) in eyes with the single-piece IOL than in those with the three-piece IOL. Both single- and three-piece IOLs tended to tilt toward the inferotemporal direction; however, there was no significant difference in the absolute values of IOL tilt at any postoperative time point. ACD at 24 hours after surgery was significantly deeper (P = 0.009) in eyes with the three-piece IOL, compared with eyes with the single-piece IOL.

Patients were prospectively randomized to be implanted with one of three types of IOLs during cataract surgery: the Ophtec Precizon (IOL A), the Lucid Korea Microflex (IOL B), and the Carl Zeiss Asphina (IOL C). One week, 2 weeks, and 6 months after surgery, the area of the anterior capsule opening was measured using digital retro-illumination images after dilation of the pupil. The data were then evaluated using POCOman software.
The study included 236 eyes of 202 patients. The area of the anterior capsule opening reduced by 3.53 ± 3.31 mm (17.06% ± 15.99%) between 1 week and 2 months post-operatively in the IOL A group, by 0.62 ± 1.32 mm (2.87% ± 6.03%) in the IOL B group, and by 1.09 ± 1.53 mm (4.72% ± 6.10%) in the IOL C group. The IOL B group showed minimal anterior capsule contraction 2 months after surgery (p < 0.001).
IOLs with a four-plate haptic design (IOL B) showed more anterior capsular stability than those with a two-loop plate haptic (IOL A) or two-plate haptic (IOL C) design. The number and position of haptics in a capsular bag may affect anterior capsule contraction. We assume that supporting the zonules evenly may play a role in anterior capsular stability.

The toriCAM application on a smartphone was then used to assess the rotational alignment of these markings and compared to the actual alignment as measured by the Zaldivar calipers on the iTrace Topographer (Tracey Technologies, Houston, TX) as a reference. The errors in marking with and without using the application were analyzed for all patients in each cohort and determined for each marking method.

We performed a prospective, descriptive, and monocentric study on patients undergoing cataract surgery with toric implantation (Asphina 709 Zeiss), operated by a surgeon with good experience in toricity, between September 2016 and March 2017. We analyzed the agreement between the manual marking of the 0°-180° axis versus the one automatically generated by the Callisto™, as well as the alignment of the IOL and the refractive results at 1 month.
We included 50 eyes of 26 patients. The corrected mean astigmatism was 1.9 D. The mean difference between the 2 axes was 4.7° [0°-12.3°]. Only 50 % of the preoperative manual markings were consistent with the automatic measurement (<5°). At one month, the average rotation recorded was 4.3° [0°-29°]. The alignment was identical for 70 % (n=35) of the IOL (≤5°). As for residual subjective astigmatism, it was on average 0.58 D. The mean visual acuity without correction was 8/10 and 55 % had 10/10 without correction.
The refractive performance depends on the preoperative measurement, the correct alignment of the IOL and its stability in the bag.

In this prospective, interventional case series, eyes of patients consecutively scheduled for cataract surgery who had clinically relevant astigmatism were implanted with a FineVision Pod FT trifocal toric IOL or an Ankoris monofocal toric IOL (both PhysIOL SA, Liège, Belgium). Certain comorbidities, such as pseudoexfoliation syndrome, were allowed. IOL rotation and total misalignment were analyzed 15 minutes, 1 day, 1 week, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively.
Seventy-one eyes of 53 patients were assessed: 37 eyes were implanted with the trifocal IOL and 34 eyes with the monofocal IOL. More IOL rotation occurred in the monofocal group compared to the trifocal group (mean 4.23° ± 4.64° vs 2.55° ± 2.62°; P = .043, 12 months). Mean total misalignment was higher in the monofocal group (6.67° ± 6.59° at 12 months vs 3.79° ± 3.59° in the trifocal group) (P = .017).

The monofocal and trifocal toric IOLs both appear to effectively reduce refractive astigmatism and provide good visual acuity in astigmatic patients having cataract surgery.

We performed a prospective, descriptive, monocentric study on patients undergoing cataract surgery with a toric intraocular lens (Asphina 709 Zeiss), performed by a surgeon with good experience in toric implants, between September 2016 and March 2017. We analyzed the agreement between the manual marking of the 0-180° axis versus the one automatically generated by the Callisto™, as well as the alignment of the IOL and the refractive results at 1 month.
We included 50 eyes of 38 patients. The mean corrected astigmatism was 1,9 D. The mean difference between the 2 axes was 4,7° [0-12.3°]. Only 50 % of the preoperative manual markings were consistent with the automated measurement (<5°). At one month, the mean rotation recorded was 4,3° [0-29°]. The alignment was identical for 70 % (n=35) of the IOLs (≤5°). As for residual subjective astigmatism, the mean was 0.58 D. The mean visual acuity without correction was 8/10 and 55 % saw 10/10 without correction.
Refractive performance depends on preoperative measurement, correct alignment of the IOL and its stability in the bag. Our study shows the value of automated conjunctival registration in the determination of the intraoperative axis of alignment, even with an experienced surgeon. This precision is essential for a good refractive result, especially since residual astigmatism in the case of misalignment will increase with the power of the implant.

However, the imported IOLs are expensive and are not affordable by all subset of patients in low- to middle-income countries like India. The aim of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of a relatively low cost indigenous IOL (Acriol EC) with an imported aspheric IOL (AcrySof IQ).
A randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care centre. Two hundred and five eyes of 137 patients >45 years of age with uncomplicated age-related cataract were recruited. All cases underwent standard phacoemulsification and randomly assigned to one of the IOL implantations (Group I: AcrySof IOL; Group II: Acriol EC IOL). Primary outcome measure was best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Secondary outcomes included visual function (VF) score, spherical equivalent, contrast sensitivity, optical aberrations, and posterior capsular opacification. Independent t-test to compare two means; Mann-Whitney test; Pearson's Chi-square test, and McNemar's test were used for analyzing the nonparametric data such as incidence of posterior capsule opacification.

Light exposure is one of the main synchronizers of circadian cycles and influences sleep by inhibiting melatonin secretion, which is mostly sensitive to light of low wavelengths (blue). Blue-blocking (yellow) intraocular lenses (IOLs) have supplanted the usual UV-blocking (clear) IOLs during cataract surgery to prevent age-related macular degeneration, however, the impact of yellow IOLs on sleep and mood is unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of yellow and clear IOLs on sleep and mood in aged patients undergoing bilateral cataract surgery.
A randomized controlled superiority study was conducted within three ophthalmic surgical wards in France. A total of 204 subjects (mean age 76.2 ± 7.5 years) were randomized into yellow or clear IOLs groups. Patients completed a sleep diary, the pictorial sleepiness scale and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) one week before and eight weeks after the last surgical procedure.
According to an Intent To Treat (ITT) analysis, no significant difference was found between yellow and clear IOLs groups regarding sleep time, sleep latency, total sleep duration, quality of sleep and BDI scores. The rate of patients whose BDI score increased at the cutoff score of ≥5 after surgery was significantly higher in the yellow IOL group (n = 11, 13.1%) compared with the clear IOL group (n = 4; 4.7%); p = 0.02.

Fifteen sites in the United States.
Prospective randomized patient- and observer-masked clinical trial.
Randomized patients received multifocal or monofocal IOLs bilaterally. Visual acuity (33 cm, 40 cm, 53 cm, 60 cm, 4 m) was measured; safety was assessed through adverse event rates. Patient-reported visual outcomes were evaluated using the Visual Tasks questionnaire. The frequency and severity of visual disturbances were evaluated using the Assessment of Photic Phenomena and Lens EffectS questionnaire.
The multifocal IOL (n = 155) provided better corrected distance visual acuity at 53 cm than the monofocal IOL (n = 165) (0.322 versus 0.512 logMAR; between-group difference, -0.190 logMAR; P < .0001) and 40 cm but not at 4 m. Ocular adverse event rates were less than 3.84% in both groups. Serious adverse event rates were comparable between the 2 IOL types. Patients with multifocal IOLs reported less difficulty with near tasks (with and without correction) and intermediate tasks (without correction). Difficulty with extended-intermediate and distance tasks was similar between groups. The most frequently reported self-rated severe phenomena were halos, starbursts, and glare. Most patients (monofocal ≥72%; multifocal ≥73%) reported never experiencing blurred, distorted, or double vision.

Refractions were performed at 1 month and every 3 months postoperatively until age 4 years and then at ages 4.25, 4.5, and 5 years. The change in refraction over time was estimated by linear mixed model analysis.
Intraocular lens implantation was completed in 56 eyes; 43 were analyzed (median age, 2.4 months; range, 1.0-6.8 months). Exclusions included 11 patients with glaucoma, 1 patient with Stickler syndrome, and 1 patient with an IOL exchange at 8 months postoperatively. The mean rate of change in a myopic direction from 1 month after cataract surgery to age 1.5 years was 0.35 diopters (D)/month (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.40 D/month); after age 1.5 years, the mean rate of change in a myopic direction was 0.97 D/year (95% CI, 0.66-1.28 D/year). The mean refractive change was 8.97 D (95% CI, 7.25-10.68 D) at age 5 years for children 1 month of age at surgery and 7.22 D (95% CI, 5.54-8.91 D) for children 6 months of age at surgery. The mean refractive error at age 5 years was -2.53 D (95% CI, -4.05 to -1.02).
After IOL implantation during infancy, the rate of myopic shift occurs most rapidly during the first 1.5 years of life. Myopic shift varies substantially among patients. If the goal is emmetropia at age 5 years, then the immediate postoperative hypermetropic targets should be +10.5 D at 4 to 6 weeks and +8.50 D from 7 weeks to 6 months.

170;28034710;A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study on Refractive Surgery in 15 011 Eyes.;[];American journal of ophthalmology;"To assess the clinical outcomes of currently used refractive surgery procedures performed in 2015.
Prospective, multicenter cohort study.
This prospective study included 15 011 eyes of 7622 consecutive patients who underwent laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), surface ablation, refractive lenticule extraction (ReLEx), or phakic intraocular lens (IOL) implantation at 42 major institutions. We determined the safety, efficacy, predictability, stability, and adverse events of these surgeries preoperatively and at 1 week and 1 and 3 months postoperatively.
Mean logMAR corrected distance visual acuity 3 months after LASIK, surface ablation, ReLEx, posterior chamber phakic IOL, or iris-supported phakic IOL implantation was -0.18 ± 0.07, -0.16 ± 0.08, -0.17 ± 0.09, -0.21 ± 0.08, and -0.10 ± 0.12, respectively; the corresponding values for logMAR uncorrected distance visual acuity were -0.15 ± 0.11, -0.12 ± 0.12, -0.12 ± 0.13, -0.15 ± 0.12, and 0.01 ± 0.21, respectively. The percentages within ±1.0 diopter (D) of the attempted correction were 96%, 93%, 97%, 99%, and 84% after LASIK, surface ablation, ReLEx, posterior chamber phakic IOL, and iris-supported phakic IOL implantation, respectively. Refractive change from 1 week to 3 months was -0.08 ± 0.07, 0.21 ± 0.63, -0.04 ± 0.41, 0.01 ± 0.31, and 0.01 ± 0.46 D, respectively.

171;28007108;Comparison of the rate of refractive growth in aphakic eyes versus pseudophakic eyes in the Infant Aphakia Treatment Study.;[];Journal of cataract and refractive surgery;"To compare the rate of refractive growth (RRG) between aphakic eyes and pseudophakic eyes in the Infant Aphakia Treatment Study (IATS).
Twelve clinical sites across the United States.
Randomized clinical trial.
Patients randomized to unilateral cataract extraction with contact lens correction versus intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in the IATS had their rate of refractive growth (RRG3) calculated based on the change in refraction from the 1-month postoperative examination to age 5 years. The RRG3 is a logarithmic formula designed to calculate the RRG in children. Two-group t tests were used to compare the mean refractive growth between the contact lens group and IOL group and outcomes based on age at surgery and visual acuity.
Longitudinal refractive data were studied for 108 of 114 patients enrolled in the IATS (contact lens group, n = 54; IOL group, n = 54). The mean RRG3 was similar in the contact lens group (-18.0 diopter [D] ± 11.0 [SD]) and the IOL group (-19.0 ± 9.0 D) (P = .49). The RRG3 value was not correlated with age at cataract surgery, glaucoma status, or visual outcome in the IOL group. In the aphakia group, only visual outcome was correlated with refractive growth (P = .01).
Infants' eyes had a similar rate of refractive growth after unilateral cataract surgery whether or not an IOL was implanted. A worse visual outcome was associated with a higher RRG in aphakic, but not pseudophakic, eyes.

Till now, we do not know exactly what the effect of intraocular lens implantation will be on the quality of sleep after cataract surgery.
The binocular BF-IOL (BF-IOL Groups) and UVB-IOL (UVB-IOL Groups) implantations were performed in 60 and 59 cataract patients, respectively. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires were administered to evaluate the quality of sleep in patients preoperatively, 1 month (1 m) and 12 months (12 m) postoperatively. Independent sample test and χ test were used to evaluate the difference between the 2 groups; one-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the difference preoperatively and postoperatively in each group. The rank sum test was used for statistical analysis of 7 independent sleep components in PSQI.
As compared to preoperatively, the PSQI overall scores in both groups improved significantly postoperatively (P = 0.00 at 1 m and 12 m). Among the 7 components of PSQI, 2 of them (sleep latency and daytime dysfunction) improved greatly postoperatively in both groups (P< 0.05).

Randomized, controlled trial involving 67 patients with age-related cataract. Intervention was cataract surgery with implantation of either a neutral or a blue-blocking intraocular lens (IOL). Main outcome was activation of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC) measured by chromatic pupillometry. The circadian rhythm was analysed by 24-hr melatonin profiles and actigraphy; the latter was also used to determine objective sleep quality. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index determined subjective sleep quality.
One year after surgery, peak melatonin concentration was 3.3 pg/ml (95% CI, 2-5.5) corresponding to 50% lower for the participants allocated to blue-blocking IOLs compared with participants allocated to neutral IOLs. Compared with preoperative levels, the ipRGC response had increased by 13.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2-22.6) 1 year after surgery. Objective sleep quality was also improved as the time of wakefulness after sleep onset had improved by 5 min (95% CI, 1-10) for the entire population while sleep efficiency had increased by two percentage points (95% CI, 0.42-3.65) although exclusively, for the participants allocated to blue-blocking IOLs.

Private practices, Boston and Chelmsford, Massachusetts, USA.
Prospective randomized case study.
Patients had cataract surgery with implantation of either a silicone IOL inferotemporally or vertically (randomly assigned) or a 1-piece acrylic IOL with the optic-haptic junction inferotemporally or vertically (randomly assigned). Other patients received acrylic IOLs bilaterally and inferotemporally without randomization. Patients were asked about negative dysphotopsia symptoms postoperatively. Data were analyzed using the z test and a chi-square test for comparing the incidence of negative dysphotopsia between the 3 groups.
The study comprised 305 patients (418 eyes). A silicone IOL was implanted inferotemporally in 39 eyes and vertically in 60 eyes. An acrylic IOL was implanted with the optic-haptic junction inferotemporally in 163 eyes and with the junction vertical in 114 eyes. Forty-two eyes had bilateral inferotemporal implantation of an acrylic IOL. For the acrylic IOL on the first postoperative day, the incidence of negative dysphotopsia was smaller for the inferotemporal IOL orientation (6%) than in the control group (14%) (P = .026). The rate of persistent negative dysphotopsia decreased in both groups over time, and the difference 1 month after surgery was no longer statistically significant. The negative dysphotopsia rate for the silicone IOL was 0%.
Positioning the optic-haptic junction of an acrylic IOL inferotemporally resulted in a 2.3-fold decrease in the incidence of negative dysphotopsia after cataract surgery. When implanted in the vertical position, Acrylic IOLs seemed to lead to a higher incidence of negative dysphotopsia than silicone IOLs.

In this prospective clinical trial, 30 pseudophakic eyes were treated with a multifocal add-on IOL and 30 cataractous eyes with a standard multifocal IOL. The main outcome measures comprised manifest refraction, visual acuity, defocus curves, and contrast sensitivity. Patients who had bilateral implantation of the same lens type were asked to complete a questionnaire.
One year postoperatively, all eyes from the multifocal add-on IOL group (add-on group) and 97% from the standard multifocal IOL group (standard group) were within ±0.50 diopters (D) of emmetropia. In both groups, median uncorrected distance and intermediate visual acuity were 20/20 and 20/25, respectively. Median uncorrected near visual acuity was 20/20 in the add-on group and 20/25 in the standard group. The survey analysis resulted in a slightly higher patient satisfaction in the standard group regarding distance and near vision without glasses. Contrast sensitivity measures were comparable in both groups. Halos were the most commonly reported visual disturbance, but the perceived impairment by light effects was minimal even in the early postoperative period and the majority of patients got used to it relatively quickly.

As yet, however, no long-term comparison of the clinical results of the implantation of ICLs with and without such a hole has hitherto been conducted. A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was carried out in order to compare the long-term clinical outcomes of the implantation, in such eyes, of ICLs with and without a central artificial hole.Examinations were conducted of the 64 eyes of 32 consecutive patients with spherical equivalents of -7.53 ± 2.39 diopters (D) (mean ± standard deviation) in whom implantation of a Hole ICL was performed in 1 eye, and that of a conventional ICL was carried out in the other, by randomized assignment. Before 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery, the safety, efficacy, predictability, stability, intraocular pressure, endothelial cell density, and adverse events of the 2 surgical techniques were assessed and compared over time.The measurements of LogMAR uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity 5 years postoperatively were -0.17 ± 0.14 and -0.24 ± 0.08 in the Hole ICL group, and -0.16 ± 0.10 and -0.25 ± 0.08 in the conventional ICL group. In these 2 groups, 96% and 100% of eyes, respectively, were within 1.0 D of the targeted correction 5 years postoperatively. Manifest refraction changed by -0.17 ± 0.41 D and -0.10 ± 0.26 D occurred in from 1 month to 5 years in the Hole and conventional ICL groups, respectively. Only 1 eye (3.1%), which was in the conventional ICL group, developed an asymptomatic anterior subcapsular cataract.Both Hole and conventional ICLs corrected of ametropia successfully throughout the 5-year observation period. It appears likely that the presence of the central hole does not significantly affect these visual and refractive outcomes.

Multicenter study at 8 investigative sites.
Prospective randomized parallel-group patient-masked 2-arm study.
This study comprised adults requiring bilateral cataract extraction followed by multifocal IOL implantation. The primary endpoint was corrected intermediate visual acuity (CIVA) at 60 cm, and the secondary endpoint was corrected near visual acuity (CNVA) at 40 cm. Both endpoints were measured 3 months after implantation with a noninferiority margin of Δ = 0.1 logMAR.
In total, 103 patients completed the study (53 bilateral, 50 contralateral). At 3 months, the mean CIVA at 60 cm was 0.13 logMAR and 0.10 logMAR in the bilateral group and contralateral group, respectively (difference 0.04 logMAR), achieving noninferiority.

The study included eyes of patients undergoing phacoemulsification and IOL implantation. Patients were randomized into 3 groups to bilaterally receive the nontoric IOL, the low toric IOL, or the moderate-to-high toric IOL. Over a 6-week follow-up period, rotational stability and astigmatic changes were evaluated in the 2 toric IOL groups using the Alpins vector method.

Postoperatively mean refractive astigmatism decreased significantly from 1.45 D ± 1.18 (SD) to 0.36 ± 0.44 D in the low toric group and from 1.92 ± 1.09 D to 0.31 ± 0.46 D in the moderate-to-high toric group. There was no significant difference between mean difference vectors in the low toric IOL group and the moderate-to-high toric IOL group. A significant difference in the correction index was detected, revealing overcorrection with low toric IOLs (1.03 ± 0.12 D) and undercorrection with moderate-to-high toric IOLs (0.95 ± 0.12 D).

Worth, TX) or manual slitlamp-assisted preoperative marking using pendulum-attached marker. Tecnis toric IOL (Abbott Medical Optics, Inc, Santa Ana, CA) was implanted in all cases. The mean postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA) for the digital-marking group was 0.12 + 0.12 logMAR, and for the manual-marking group was 0.18 + 0.14 logMAR (P = 0.104). The mean deviation from targeted induced astigmatism (TIA) for the first group was 0.10 + 0.08 D and for the second group was 0.20 + 0.14 D (P = 0.001). The mean postoperative toric IOL misalignment measured by the slitlamp was 2.4° + 1.96° for the first group and was 4.33° + 2.72° for the second group (P = 0.003). Accurate alignment of the toric IOL is important to achieve the desired astigmatism correction.

212;26233628;The Effect of Cataract Surgery on Circadian Photoentrainment: A Randomized Trial of Blue-Blocking versus Neutral Intraocular Lenses.;[];Ophthalmology;"Cataract decreases blue light transmission. Because of the selective blue light sensitivity of the retinal ganglion cells governing circadian photoentrainment, cataract may interfere with normal sleep-wake regulation and cause sleep disturbances. The purpose was to investigate the effect of cataract surgery on circadian photoentrainment and to determine any difference between blue-blocking and neutral intraocular lenses (IOLs).
The study was a single-center, investigator-driven, double-masked, block-randomized clinical trial.
One eye in 76 patients with bilateral age-related cataract eligible for cataract surgery was included.
Intervention was cataract surgery by phacoemulsification. Patients were randomized to receive a blue-blocking or neutral IOL.
Primary outcome was activation of intrinsic photosensitive ganglion cells using post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) to blue light from 10 to 30 seconds after light exposure as a surrogate measure. Secondary outcomes were circadian rhythm analysis using actigraphy and 24-hour salivary melatonin measurements. Finally, objective and subjective sleep quality were determined by actigraphy and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
The blue light PIPR increased 2 days (17%) and 3 weeks (24%) after surgery (P < 0.001). The majority of circadian and sleep-specific actigraphy parameters did not change after surgery. A forward shift of the circadian rhythm by 22 minutes (P = 0.004) for actigraphy and a tendency toward an earlier melatonin onset (P = 0.095) were found. Peak salivary melatonin concentration increased after surgery (P = 0.037). No difference was detected between blue-blocking and neutral IOLs, whereas low preoperative blue light transmission was inversely associated with an increase in PIPR (P = 0.021) and sleep efficiency (P = 0.048).
Cataract surgery increases photoreception by the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. Because of inconsistency between the significant findings and the many parameters that were unchanged, we can conclude that cataract surgery does not adversely affect the circadian rhythm or sleep. Longer follow-up time and fellow eye surgery may reveal the significance of the subtle changes observed. We found no difference between blue-blocking and neutral IOLs, and, because of the minor effect of surgery in itself, an effect of IOL type seems highly unlikely.";;;The blue light PIPR increased 2 days (17%) and 3 weeks (24%) after surgery (P < 0.001).

The main outcome measures were uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), residual cylinder, contrast sensitivity, glare acuity, pain score, and higher-order aberrations.
At 6 months 53.3% of eyes in the toric IOL and 60% eyes in the monofocal IOL with PRK group attained UDVA of 20/20. Median residual refractive cylinder value was higher in the toric IOL group (toric IOL = -0.5, monofocal IOL with PRK = 0; P = .02). Mean root mean square value of total aberrations (5 mm pupil) was higher in monofocal IOL with PRK eyes (toric IOL= 1.02 ± 0.44, monofocal IOL with PRK = 1.28 ± 0.5; P = .04). Mean contrast sensitivity values were comparable. Mean toric IOL rotation was 1.3 ± 2.1 degrees. Mean glare acuity was better in toric IOL eyes (toric IOL = 0.46 ± 0.16, monofocal IOL with PRK = 0.73 ± 0.12; P < .001). Median postoperative pain scores were higher in monofocal IOL with PRK eyes.

This prospective multicenter clinical trial included 93 eyes of 61 patients that were implanted with a hydrophobic acrylic toric IOL from 2010 to 2012 and followed for 1 year. This IOL uses the platform of a microincision one-piece aspheric IOL, the NY-60 IOL (HOYA, Tokyo, Japan), with three increments in cylindrical power (NHT15, 1.5 diopters [D]; NHT23, 2.25 D; and NHT30, 3.0 D). The inclusion criterion was preoperative corneal astigmatism from 0.75 to 3.00 D. The primary endpoint was uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) of 0.0 logMAR (20/20 Snellen) or better 6 months postoperatively. In addition to UDVA, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), residual astigmatism, stability of the IOL alignment, need of realignment, and the rate of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy were evaluated up to 1 year postoperatively. Errors in astigmatic correction were assessed using Alpin's vector analysis.
The primary endpoint was achieved in 54.8% of eyes. One year postoperatively, the logMAR UDVAs were 0.02 ± 0.13, 0.05 ± 0.17, and 0.09 ± 0.14 with models NHT15, NHT23, and NHT30, which corresponds to 0.96 (19/20 Snellen), 0.89 (18/20 Snellen), and 0.82 (16/20 Snellen), respectively.

In this prospective study, 40 eyes of patients 6 to 16 years old with developmental cataract were randomly assigned to receive a spherical IOL or an aspheric IOL after pediatric cataract surgery. At 3 months postoperatively, the outcomes compared between the two groups were best-corrected visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and wavefront aberrometry.
The mean best-corrected visual acuity was 0.32 ± 0.19 logMAR in the spherical IOL group and 0.28 ± 0.16 logMAR in the aspheric IOL group (P = .179).

225;25976638;Matched optical quality comparison of 3-year results of PRK-MMC and phakic IOL implantation in the correction of high myopia.;[];Eye (London, England);"To compare 3-year results of PRK-MMC and phakic intraocular lens (PIOL) implantation in patients with >8.0 diopters (D) of myopia.
This study was conducted as a non-randomized clinical trial on 23 eyes treated with PIOL (Artiflex; group A) and 23 eyes treated with PRK-MMC (group B). This report compares 3-year treatment results in these two groups.
At 3 years after surgery, uncorrected visual acuity was 0.02±0.06 LogMAR in group A and 0.04±0.07 LogMAR in group B (P=0.639). Mean best corrected visual acuity in group A (0.004±0.02) was better than group B (0.03±0.07 LogMAR) (P=0.035). Mean manifest refraction spherical equivalent was -0.16±0.21 and -0.09±0.20D (P=0.190), respectively. Mesopic contrast sensitivity (CS) in the spatial frequency of three cycle/degree (CS3) significantly decreased in both groups, but the reduction was significantly higher in group B (P=0.024). CS6 decreased significantly only in group B (P=0.019). Changes in CS12 and CS18 showed no significant inter-group difference. In group A, the increase in C6 trefoil (0.16±0.18 μm, P=0.003) and reduction in spherical aberration (SA; 0.16±0.08 μm, P<0.001) were statistically significant. In group B, the reduction in vertical coma (P=0.052), and increases in horizontal coma (P=0.044), coma (P<0.001), SA (P<0.001), and total higher order aberrations (P<0.001) were significant after surgery.

226;25968007;The effect of blue-blocking intraocular lenses on circadian biological rhythm: protocol for a randomised controlled trial (CLOCK-IOL colour study).;['ONCOLOGY'];BMJ open;"Blue light information plays an important role in synchronising internal biological rhythm within the external environment. Circadian misalignment is associated with the increased risk of sleep disturbance, obesity, diabetes mellitus, depression, ischaemic heart disease, stroke and cancer. Meanwhile, blue light causes photochemical damage to the retina, and may be associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). At present, clear intraocular lenses (IOLs) and blue-blocking IOLs are both widely used for cataract surgery; there is currently a lack of randomised controlled trials to determine whether clear or blue-blocking IOLs should be used.
This randomised controlled trial will recruit 1000 cataract patients and randomly allocate them to receive clear IOLs or blue-blocking IOLs in a ratio of 1:1. The primary outcomes are mortality and the incidence of cardiovascular disease, cancer and AMD. Secondary outcomes are fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, glycated haemoglobin, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness depressive symptoms, light sensitivity, the circadian rhythm of physical activity, wrist skin temperature and urinary melatonin metabolite. Primary outcomes will be followed until 20 years after surgery, and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 1 year after surgery.

KAMRA inlay subjects demonstrated improved intermediate and near vision with minimal to no change to distance vision, better contrast sensitivity in the inlay eye when compared to the multifocals, and better binocular contrast sensitivity when compared to all 3 intraocular lenses. Crystalens AO was superior in uncorrected intermediate vision compared to the KAMRA inlay, but not in distance-corrected intermediate, and was worse in near vision. The multifocals were superior in near vision at their respective optimum near focus points, but worse in intermediate vision compared to both KAMRA inlay and Crystalens AO.
The demonstrated performance of these devices should be considered, along with subjects' visual demands and expectations, degree of crystalline lens dysfunction, and other ocular characteristics, in guiding the selection of small-aperture corneal inlay or specific intraocular lens in the correction of presbyopia.";;;KAMRA inlay subjects demonstrated improved intermediate and near vision with minimal to no change to distance vision, better contrast sensitivity in the inlay eye when compared to the multifocals, and better binocular contrast sensitivity when compared to all 3 intraocular lenses.

We wondered which procedure, whether a Presbylasik technique called Regular Supracor or the intraocular surgery of clear lens replacement by a trifocal diffractive lens (presbyopic lens exchange [Prelex]), provided the best results (in visual acuity and satisfaction) for our hyperopic and presbyopic patients between 55 and 70. The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of the two techniques (at one week and three months) and to assess patients' quality of life.
This study is a retrospective monocentric clinical trial conducted between June 2011 and March 2014, on 21 hyperopic presbyopic patients (mean age 60.9 years), in the ""hôpital d'instruction des armées-Percy"" (Clamart); 13 patients underwent the corneal treatment of Presbylasik (with the Intralase FS60 femtosecond laser [AMO, USA] and the Technolas 217P excimer laser [Technolas Perfect Vision, GmbH] following the Zyoptix Tissue-Saving algorithm adjusted with a nomogram and the Regular Supracor mode), and 8 patients underwent clear lens extraction (Prelex), through bimanual phacoemulsification and implantation of diffractive trifocal intraocular lenses (Finevision Micro F, PhysIOL(*)).

In the Prelex group, the mean uncorrected one week binocular VA was 0.025 (0-0.1) for distance vision and 0.165 (0.06-0.18) for near distance and the three months visual acuity was 0 (-0.1-0.1) and 0.105 (0.06-0.18) for distance and near vision. All Prelex patients were spectacle-free at all distances, whereas 4 Supracor patients required spectacles for near vision postoperatively. Seven of 11 patients in the Supracor group and 100% of the Prelex patients were completely satisfied. Both groups experienced halos, but patients reported more halos in the Prelex group (75%). One eye required intraocular lens exchange and four eyes (16.7%) required a new corneal procedure in the Supracor group.

Assessment 12 months postoperatively included photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity testing. Higher-order aberrations (HOAs) were computed. FDT testing was divided into four areas to evaluate the variation of the values at different points. The median values of the local pattern thresholds (median area contrast sensitivity [MACS]) obtained with that division were calculated.
The Akreos AO group obtained statistically significantly lower values of HOAs and spherical aberration compared with the Akreos Fit group.

Double-masked, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial.
A total of 188 patients undergoing bilateral sequential cataract surgery or bilateral refractive lens exchange.
Patients were preoperatively randomized (allocation ratio 1:1) to bilateral implantation with the AT LISA 809M IOL or ReSTOR SN6AD1 IOL. Postoperative outcomes were assessed 4 to 8 months after second eye surgery.
The primary outcome was visual symptoms evaluated with the Quality of Vision (QoV) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included other questionnaire data (CatQuest-9SF, spectacle independence, vision satisfaction, and dysphotopsia) and visual function measures (near, intermediate, and distance visual acuity, binocular reading speed [International Reading Speed Texts], contrast sensitivity, and forward light scatter). Adverse events, including intraoperative and postoperative complications, also were evaluated.
There was no significant difference between IOL groups in Rasch-adjusted QoV scores for frequency (P = 0.95), severity (P = 0.56), and bothersomeness (P = 0.34) of visual symptoms; median (interquartile) scores for these QoV subscales were 29 (15-37), 22 (13-27), and 14 (0-29) for the AT LISA 809M IOL group, respectively, and 32 (15-37), 22 (13-30), and 14 (0-29) for the ReSTOR SN6AD1 IOL group, respectively.

Prospective randomized controlled trial.
Each eye of patients having bilateral surgery for age-related cataract was randomized to have implantation of a 1-piece IOL (Tecnis ZCB00) or a 3-piece IOL (Tecnis ZA9003). Changes in visual acuity, refraction, and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were evaluated during a 2-year follow-up. Intraocular lens tilt and decentration were evaluated using a Purkinje meter. Regeneratory posterior capsule opacification (PCO) was analyzed using retroillumination photographs in Automated Quantification of After-Cataract image-analysis software.
This study comprised 100 eyes of 50 patients. No statistically significant differences were found in IOL tilt or decentration between groups (P≥.06). Minimal but statistically significant changes were observed in the vertical tilt component 12 months postoperatively in the 3-piece IOL group (P<.01). The tilt and decentration components did not correlate with changes in sphere or the regeneratory PCO score (r = 0.38, P≥.06). The ACD decreased significantly between 1 day and 1 month postoperatively in both groups (P<.01), with no significant changes afterward (P≥.22). The anterior chamber was significantly deeper in the 1-piece group at all follow-up visits (P<.01).
Both the 1-piece IOL and the 3-piece IOL showed excellent positional stability in the capsular bag, resulting in good clinical outcomes. Regeneratory PCO levels were low and comparable between the IOLs.

Eighty eyes with dense nuclear cataracts were enrolled in a prospective, randomized controlled study. Patients were assigned to two groups. In Group I, the IOL was traditionally implanted after all nuclear fragments were completely removed, and in Group II, the IOL was innovatively implanted in the bag before the last residual nuclear fragment was removed. This novel adjusted surgical procedure, named the ""IOL-shell technique"", features use of the IOL as a protective barrier rather than simply as a refractive alternative, and it is conceptually different from the traditional step-by-step procedure. Clinical examinations, including uncorrected visual acuity, central corneal thickness (CCT), temporal clear corneal incision thickness and corneal endothelial cell density, were carried out.
The inter-group difference in temporal corneal thickness was found to be of no statistical significance at any of the visits. Compared to eyes in Group I, those in Group II were shown to have significantly less corneal endothelial cell loss on both the 7th and 30th day following surgery. At 7 days after surgery, the mean corneal endothelial cell loss in Group II was 10.29%, compared to 14.37% in Group I (P<0.05). The mean endothelial cell loss measured on postoperative day 30 was 16.88% in Group II compared to 23.32% in Group I (P<0.05). On the 1st day after surgery, the mean CCT of eyes in Group II was significantly smaller compared to Group I (Group I vs. Group II: 19.42% vs. 13.50%, P<0.05).

The Infant Aphakia Treatment Study (IATS) is a randomized, multicenter clinical trial comparing IOL to contact lens (CL) treatment with a unilateral infantile cataract in participants who underwent cataract surgery at 1 to 6 months of age. At age 4.5 years, eye movements were recorded in 103 participants, using a high-speed video camera while the child performed a fixation task. The recordings were inspected by masked readers for the presence of fixation instabilities (nystagmus and saccadic oscillations).
Overall, fixation instabilities were observed in 50 (60%) of 83 children who had evaluable recordings, with no differences between treatment groups (27 [64%] of 42 in the IOL group, 23 [56%] of 41 in the CL group; P = 0.51). Nystagmus was seen in 38% and saccadic oscillations in 31%, with no differences between treatment groups (P > 0.33). Children without a fixation instability had better visual acuity (P = 0.04).
Nystagmus and saccadic oscillations are well-known consequences of infantile cataracts, presumably the result of visual deprivation during the critical period of visual development. After early cataract extraction, successful optical correction may reduce further form deprivation and minimize the incidence of these fixation instabilities. In this study, no differences in the presence of fixation instabilities were found between the two treatment strategies (CL or IOL) for optical correction after cataract removal.

255;25070400;[Clinical results of a multifocal pseudophakic additional lens].;[];Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft;"In order to meet the patients wish for compensation of presbyopia in a flexible way, even in cases of an already pseudophacic eye, sulcus-fixated additional intraocular lenses (IOL) have been developed as an alternative to multifocal IOLs (MIOL) in the capsular bag. This allows subsequent application of multifocal optics. Furthermore, these additional lenses offer a relatively simple opportunity for postoperative refractive fine tuning or, in cases of incompatibility, a minimally invasive explantation of the multifocal part of the optical system.
The objective of our work was the examination of a diffractive multifocal additional IOL and its functional characteristics.
In a prospective, monocentric trial 32 eyes of 21 patients had cataract surgery with implantation of a monofocal IOL into the capsular bag and simultaneous implantation of a multifocal additional IOL into the sulcus. The visual acuity was tested at different distances 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively. At the 3 month follow-up contrast sensitivity and defocus curves were additionally assessed. Patients with bilateral implantation filled in a questionnaire to assess their subjective satisfaction of postoperative visual quality.
All eyes had an uneventful postoperative course. At both follow-ups an uncorrected distance and near visual acuity (VA) of 0.2 LogMAR or better was achieved. In intermediate vision 29 out of 32 eyes after 6 weeks and 31 out of 32 eyes after 3 months reached an uncorrected VA of 0.2 LogMAR or better. The defocus curves showed a typical two-peaked shape. At intermediate distance (-1.5 D of defocus) the median VA was 0.35 LogMAR. Contrast sensitivity testing showed results in the upper region of the standard range of age-matched, healthy patients.
The examined type of diffractive additional IOL achieved good to very good functional results, which are comparable to corresponding IOLs in the capsular bag. Multifocal additional IOLs can be considered as a useful extension of refractive surgical alternatives for the compensation of presbyopia. The possibility to implant the multifocal optic part independently of the primary surgery, the minimal invasivity of the procedure and the likewise time-independent reversibility can be pointed out as special qualities of these IOL.";;;All eyes had an uneventful postoperative course.

University Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.
Prospective nonrandomized clinical trial.
Eyes with a light-adjustable IOL (LAL) were treated with spatial intensity profiles to correct refractive errors. The effective changes in refraction in the light-adjustable IOL after every treatment were estimated by subtracting those in the whole eye and the cornea, which were measured with a Hartmann-Shack sensor and a corneal topographer, respectively. The refractive changes in the whole eye and light-adjustable IOL, manifest refraction, and visual acuity were obtained after every light treatment and at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups.
The study enrolled 53 eyes (49 patients). Each tested light spatial pattern (5 spherical; 3 astigmatic) produced a different refractive change (P<.01). The combination of 2 light adjustments induced a maximum change in spherical power of the light-adjustable IOL of between -1.98 diopters (D) and +2.30 D and in astigmatism of up to -2.68 D with axis errors below 9 degrees. Intersubject variability (standard deviation) ranged between 0.10 D and 0.40 D. The 2 required lock-in procedures induced a small myopic shift (range +0.01 to +0.57 D) that depended on previous adjustments.
Light-adjustable IOL implantation achieved accurate refractive outcomes (around emmetropia) with good uncorrected distance visual acuity, which remained stable over time. Further refinements in nomograms and in the treatment's protocol would improve the predictability of refractive and visual outcomes with these IOLs.

113 eyes were implanted with Crystal Evolution® (MTO) IOLs and 261 eyes with AF-1 iMics1® (Hoya) IOLs. The predictability of the postoperative spherical equivalence (SE) and the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were compared between both groups. The predictability was also compared to 2 previous studies.
With Crystal Evolution®, the predictability was significantly better than with AF-1 iMics1® (p<0.0001). The results were also better than those described in the 2 studies. Although the BCVA obtained with Crystal Evolution® were better than with AF-1 iMics1®, the difference were not significant.

Public university hospital and private clinic.
Preoperatively, all intraocular distances were measured using laser biometry. Various IOL designs were studied; powers ranged from -5.0 diopters (D) to +38.0 D. The IOL power calculation was performed with the Olsen formula using the C constant and compared with the Haigis, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, and the SRK/T formulas on optimized datasets. Outcome measures were the error of the prediction, expressed as the arithmetic error, and the absolute error between the observed refraction and the predicted refraction.
Two thousand forty-three cases from the 2 centers were studied. No significant differences were found between the Haigis, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, and SRK/T formulas with the exception of the SRK/T formula, which performed better than the other thin-lens formulas in eyes with an axial length (AL) greater than 27.0 mm (P<.01). Compared with the SRK/T formula, the Olsen formula showed an improvement of 15% and 14% in the mean absolute error and a 39% and 85% reduction in the number of large errors (>1.0 D) for the 2 series, respectively (P<.0001). Contrary to the Olsen formula, all thin-lens formulas showed a significant bias in terms of the AL, keratometry reading, and anterior segment length (P<.0001).

The study was conducted at the Angers University Hospital, France. This was a prospective with a lowercase pilot study, including consecutive patients planned to undergo cataract surgery in both eyes within 1 week. The same type of IOL was used in both eyes of each patient. The choice of IOL was not randomized but driven by the habits and experience of each participating surgeon. Cognitively healthy patients (an MMSE score higher than 25) were assessed before and after surgery, using the 30-item geriatric depression scale (GDS) to seek symptoms of depression. Univariate and multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the association between the type of IOL and the 30-item GDS score improvement during the 3 months after lens implantation, while adjusting for participants' characteristics (age, visual acuity). Blue-filtering IOLs were used in 16 patients (mean ± standard deviation, 75.6 ± 7.5 years; 75 % female), and untinted IOLs in 18 patients (77.3 ± 6.9 years; 77.8 %female).

There was no significant difference between the median visual acuity of operated eyes in children who underwent primary IOL implantation and those left aphakic. However, there were significantly more adverse events and additional intraoperative procedures in the IOL group. When operating on an infant younger than 7 months of age with a unilateral cataract, we recommend leaving the eye aphakic and focusing the eye with a contact lens. Primary IOL implantation should be reserved for those infants where, in the opinion of the surgeon, the cost and handling of a contact lens would be so burdensome as to result in significant periods of uncorrected aphakia.

Patients with bilateral symptomatic cataract had bilateral sequential cataract surgery within 6 weeks with randomized implantation of the accommodating or monofocal IOL in both eyes. Exclusion criteria included other ocular conditions and corneal astigmatism greater than 2.00 diopters. The primary outcome was uniocular distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA). Secondary measures were IOL movement, depth of focus, intermediate and distance vision, objective refraction, and pupil size at distance and near fixation. Results from 3 months postoperatively are presented.
Three months postoperatively, 64 patients (32 in each group) were available for study. The distance vision was not statistically significantly different between the accommodating IOL and monofocal IOL (mean 0.05 logMAR versus 0.06 logMAR).

In addition, the influence of the type of test employed for the evaluation of stereo-acuity was explored.
Six months after cataract intervention, stereo-acuity was measured with the Titmus and TNO stereotests in 143 patients implanted with one of the following MIOL lens types: hybrid spherical SN60D3, hybrid aspheric SN6AD1, diffractive aspheric ZMA00 and refractive spherical NXG1. A control group implanted with the monofocal aspheric ZA9003 (in which stereo-acuity was measured with a near addition) was also included in the study.
Statistically significant better stereo-acuity was found in the monofocal group with both stereotests (except for the SN60D3 group with the Titmus test) (all p < 0.001). No significant differences in stereo-acuity between MIOLs were found using the Titmus test.

Patients implanted with MIOLs have worse stereo-acuity than those implanted with monofocal IOLs due to the decrease in retinal image contrast originating in the simultaneous presence of two images.

Healthy, non astigmats had +1.50D astigmatism induced with spectacle lenses at 90°, 135°, 180° and +3.00D at 90°. Two correcting cylindrical lenses of the opposite sign and half the power each were subsequently added to the trial frame misaligned by 0°, 5° or 10° in a random order and misorientated from the initial axis in a clockwise direction by up to 15° in 5° steps. A second group of adapted astigmats with between 1.00 and 3.00DC had their astigmatism corrected with two toric spectacle lenses of half the power separated by 0°, 5° or 10° and misorientated from the initial axis in both directions by up to 15° in 5° steps. Distance, high contrast visual acuity was measured using a computerised test chart at each lens misalignment and misorientation.
Misorientation of the split toric lenses caused a statistically significant drop in visual acuity (F=70.341; p<0.001). Comparatively better acuities were observed around 180°, as anticipated (F=3.775; p=0.035).

Before bilateral sequential cataract surgery, patients were randomized (allocation ratio 1:1) to receive bilateral Tecnis ZM900 diffractive multifocal lenses (Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA) or Akreos AO monofocal lenses (Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY) with the powers adjusted to target -1.25 diopters (D) monovision. Outcomes were assessed 4 months after the second eye underwent operation.
The primary outcome was spectacle independence. Secondary outcomes included questionnaires (VF-11R, dysphotopsia symptoms, and satisfaction) and visual function measures (near, intermediate, and distance logarithm of minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] visual acuity, stereoacuity, contrast sensitivity, and forward light scatter).
A total of 212 patients were randomized, and 187 patients (88%) returned for assessment 4 months after surgery. Uniocular distance refractions in the monovision arm showed a mean spherical equivalent of +0.075 D in the distance eye and -0.923 in the near eye. In the multifocal arm, the mean distance spherical equivalents were -0.279 D and -0.174 D in the right and left eyes, respectively. A total of 24 of 93 patients (25.8%) in the monovision arm and 67 of 94 patients (71.3%) in the multifocal arm reported never wearing glasses (P<0.001, Fisher exact test). The adjusted odds ratio of being spectacle free was 7.51 (95% confidence interval, 3.89-14.47). Binocular uncorrected acuities did not differ significantly for distance (0.058 logMAR for monovision vs. 0.076 for multifocal, P = 0.3774) but were significantly worse in the multifocal arm for intermediate acuity (0.149 vs. 0.221, P = 0.0001) and in the monovision arm for near acuity (0.013 vs. -0.025, P = 0.037). In the first postoperative year, 6 patients (5.7%) in the multifocal arm underwent IOL exchange (4 had a bilateral and 2 had a unilateral exchange). No patients in the monovision arm underwent IOL exchange.
Patients randomized to bilateral implantation with the diffractive multifocal Tecnis ZM900 were more likely to report being spectacle independent but also more likely to undergo IOL exchange than those randomized to receive monofocal implants (Akreos AO) with the powers adjusted to give low monovision.";;;A total of 212 patients were randomized, and 187 patients (88%) returned for assessment 4 months after surgery.

The protocol targeted postoperative hyperopia of +6.0 or +8.0 diopters (D). Eyes were excluded for invalid biometry, lack of refractive data at the specified postoperative visit, diagnosis of glaucoma or suspected glaucoma, or sulcus IOL placement. Actual refraction 1 month after surgery was converted to spherical equivalent and prediction error (predicted refraction - actual refraction) was calculated. Baseline characteristics were analyzed for effect on prediction error for each formula. The main outcome measure was absolute prediction error.
Forty-three eyes were studied; mean axial length was 18.1 ± 1.1 mm (in 23 eyes, it was <18.0 mm). Average age at surgery was 2.5 ± 1.5 months. Holladay 1 showed the lowest median absolute prediction error (1.2 D); a paired comparison of medians showed clinically similar results using the Holladay 1 and SRK/T formulae (median difference, 0.3 D).

The data on PCO scores were compared with those of a conventional spherical hydrophobic IOL (Acrysof SN60AT).
One hundred percent CDVA was significantly better at 12 months and 9% CDVA was better at 6, 12, and 24 months (P<.05) with the negatively aspheric IOL.

Patients were randomized to bilateral implantation of the Crystalens HD silicone accommodating IOL, the Tetraflex acrylic accommodating IOL, or the Tecnis 1-piece monofocal (nonaccommodating) control IOL. The target refraction for the control group was mini-monovision (-0.25 diopter [D] and -0.75 D).

Randomized examiner-masked clinical trial.
Patients were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 groups for preoperative corneal marking in the sitting position. The 4 methods used were marking at the slitlamp with an insulin needle, a pendular marker, a bubble marker, and a tonometer marker. The marks were then documented with a standardized photographic technique, and the rotational deviation and vertical misalignment were assessed.
The study enrolled 60 patients. The pendular-marking device showed the least rotational deviation to the reference meridian (mean 1.8 degrees). There was no statistically significant difference between slitlamp marking and pendular marking (P = .05); however, there was a significant difference between the pendular marker and the bubble marker and between the pendular marker and the tonometer marker (P = .01 and P < .01, respectively). The least vertical misalignment was observed with the slitlamp-marking device (mean 0.28 mm). There was no statistically significant difference in vertical misalignment between the 4 groups.
All marking devices showed a slight deviation to the horizontal reference meridian. Because small deviations of the meridian can result in a relevant reduction in the astigmatism-reducing effect with toric intraocular lenses, accurate marking of the cornea before surgery is critical due to the variable cyclotorsion caused by a change from the upright to the supine position.

Clinical trial.
Eyes with age-related cataract had cataract surgery with implantation of a nonaccommodating IOL (AF-1 YA-60BB). Surgery was performed with primary posterior CCC and posterior buttonholing in 1 eye (study eyes) and with conventional in-the-bag implantation in the contralateral eye (control eyes). After a minimum of 6 months postoperatively, the anterior chamber depth was assessed with partial coherence interferometry before and after application of pilocarpine 2.0% and, after a washout interval of 1 week, before and after the application of cyclopentolate 1.0%.
Forty eyes of 20 patients were enrolled. A slight backward shift of the IOL (+78 μm) in study eyes and in control eyes (+118 μm) was detected after pilocarpine application (both P<.05). No significant difference in IOL shift was found between study eyes and control eyes (P=.19).
Combined primary posterior CCC and posterior optic buttonholing did not affect IOL shift during pharmacologically stimulated ciliary muscle contraction compared with in-the-bag implanted IOLs. Capsule fibrosis diminished with primary posterior CCC but did not seem to be the only limiting factor in the accommodative IOL shift.

SRK II, SRK/T, Hoffer-Q, Holladay 1 and Haigis formula].;[];Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft;"The aim of the study was an assessment of refraction error after implantation of two types of hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lenses and derivation of customized IOL constants for the SRK II, SRK/T, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1 and Haigis formula.
The purpose of the present study was to analyze the refractive outcome of two hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lenses and to present a computerized calculation scheme for customization of lens-specific parameters provided by the lens manufacturers based on the refractive results of a surgeon or study center.
In this prospective monocentric study 100 consecutive cataract eyes were treated at the Eye Hospital of the Barmherzige Brüder (Compassionate Brothers) in Linz/Austria with a hydrophobic acrylic aspherical intraocular lens (Polytech Y10AS, n = 50) or a hydrophobic acrylic spherical intraocular lens (Hoya PC-60R, n = 50). The biometrical data were assessed preoperatively together with the refractive outcome 8-10 weeks after treatment in order to analyze the deviation of postoperative refraction (spherical equivalent) from target refraction (ΔREF) and to customize the lens constants for the SRK II, SRK/T, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1 and Haigis formula.
Based on this data set it could be demonstrated that using the lens constant provided by the manufacturer (ΔREF) the Polytech lens showed a systematic trend to myopia in contrast to the Hoya lens which ranged around zero. This trend could be compensated by selecting appropriate lens specific constants. For the Polytech/Hoya lens median lens constants of: A = 118.0/118.6 (SRK II), A = 117.9/118.6 (SRK/T), pACD = 4.8/5.1 (Hoffer Q), SF = 1.1/1.5 (Holladay I) and d = 4.2/4.6 (Haigis) were extracted and using linear regression a lens constant triplet for the Haigis formula of a(0) = 4.39, a(1) = 0.29, a(2) = 0.11/a0 = 4.73, a(1) = 0.30, a(2) = -0.01 could be derived.
Ophthalmic surgeons or surgical centers are encouraged to check (refractive) outcomes after cataract surgery permanently in terms of quality control.

A total of 68 eyes of 50 patients with high axial myopia (axis length ≥ 28.00 mm) with and without cataract who underwent complication-free phacoemulsification and IOL implantation were retrospectively examined.

This article examines the relationship between adherence to patching and grating acuity.
Data came from the Infant Aphakia Treatment Study, a randomized clinical trial of treatment for unilateral congenital cataract. Infants were either left aphakic (n = 53) or had an intraocular lens implanted (n = 55). Patching was prescribed 1 hour per day per month of age until 8 months of age and 50% of waking hours thereafter. Adherence was measured as the mean percentage of prescribed patching reported in a 7-day diary completed 2 months after surgery, and 48-hour recall interviews conducted 3 and 6 months after surgery. Grating visual acuity was measured within 1 month of the infant's first birthday (n = 108) using Teller Acuity Cards by a tester masked to treatment. Nonparametric correlations were used to examine the relationship with grating acuity.
On average, caregivers reported patching 84.3% (SD = 31.2%) of prescribed time and adherence did not differ by treatment (t = -1.40, df = 106, p = 0.16). Adherence was associated with grating acuity (r(Spearman) = -0.27, p < 0.01), but more so among pseudophakic (r(Spearman) = -0.41, p < 0.01) than aphakic infants (r(Spearman) = -0.10, p = 0.49).
This study empirically has shown that adherence to patching during the first 6 months after surgery is associated with better grating visual acuity at 12 months of age after treatment for unilateral cataract and that implanting an intraocular lens is not associated with adherence.

Eyes randomized to receive primary IOL implantation were targeted for a postoperative refraction of +8.0 diopters (D) for infants 28 to 48 days old at surgery and +6.0 D for those 49 days or older to younger than 7 months at surgery using the Holladay 1 formula. Refraction 1 month after surgery was converted to spherical equivalent, and prediction error (PE; defined as the calculated refraction minus the actual refraction) and absolute PE were calculated. Baseline eye and surgery characteristics and A-scan quality were analyzed to compare their effect on PE.
Prediction error.
Fifty-six eyes underwent primary IOL implantation; 7 were excluded for lack of postoperative refraction (n = 5) or incorrect technique in refraction (n = 1) or biometry (n = 1). Overall mean (SD) absolute PE was 1.8 (1.3) D and mean (SD) PE was +1.0 (2.0) D. Absolute PE was less than 1 D in 41% of eyes but greater than 2 D in 41% of eyes. Mean IOL power implanted was 29.9 D (range, 11.5-40.0 D); most eyes (88%) implanted with an IOL of 30.0 D or greater had less postoperative hyperopia than planned. Multivariate analysis revealed that only short axial length (<18 mm) was significant for higher PE.
Short axial length correlates with higher PE after IOL placement in infants. Less hyperopia than anticipated occurs with axial lengths of less than 18 mm or high-power IOLs. Application to Clinical Practice Quality A-scans are essential and higher PE is common, with a tendency for less hyperopia than expected.

Prospective observational case series.
This study enrolled eyes that had AcrySof toric IOL implantation. The AL was measured using optical coherence biometry or immersion A-scan biometry. Corneal astigmatism was determined by manual keratometry and topography. The IOL alignment was vertical, horizontal, or oblique. Rotational stability was measured using the purpose-designed software, and the mean absolute difference was determined. The effect of AL and IOL alignment on rotational stability was determined 6 months postoperatively.
The study evaluated 168 eyes (168 patients). The mean AL was 23.86 mm ± 1.63 (SD), (range 19.50 to 29.03 mm). The median IOL rotation was 0.3 degree from baseline to 1 week, 1.0 degree from 1 week to 1 month, 0.2 degree from 1 to 3 months, and 0.1 degree from 3 to 6 months. The maximum rotation occurred between 1 week and 1 month. There was a strong correlation between AL and IOL rotation at 6 months (r = 0.93, P<.001). The mean absolute difference at 6 months was not significantly different between the 3 axis placement categories when correlated with the rotation (P=.102, analysis of variance).

The Epi.Lens was implanted for the first time in 48 consecutive eyes of 25 patients in an ongoing two-center clinical study. Pre- and postoperative manifest refraction, uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), intraocular pressure, slit-lamp and funduscopic examination, and ultrasound biomicroscopy were evaluated. Follow-up examinations were performed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. For each patient, the latest follow-up data were considered.
The study cohort consisted of highly myopic patients with mean preoperative manifest refraction spherical equivalent of -9.90 ± 2.53 D, which was reduced to -0.26 ± 0.84 D postoperatively. Two (4.2%) eyes lost one line of CDVA postoperatively, whereas 19 (40%) met and 27 (56%) eyes exceeded preoperative CDVA values, thus improving mean CDVA from 0.83 ± 0.30 to 1.03 ± 0.26. Mean postoperative UDVA (0.85 ± 0.37) was similar to preoperative CDVA (0.83 ± 0.30). When considering all eyes with good visual potential (preoperative CDVA ≥ 1.00 [20/20] [n=25]), 20 (80%) achieved postoperative UDVA ≥ 1.00 (20/20), and 24 (96%) achieved UDVA ≥ 0.80 (20/25). One lens with a small diameter showed contact of the Epi.Lens and crystalline lens with subsequent slight anterior subcapsular cataract; however, CDVA was 1.00 (20/20) at last follow-up 2 years postoperatively.

Patients with bilateral cataract received a microincision cataract surgery (MICS) IOL in 1 eye and a small-incision cataract surgery (SICS) IOL in the contralateral eye. Follow-up examinations were performed immediately after surgery and postoperatively at 1 week and 3 and 24 months. Posterior capsule opacification was assessed using retroillumination photography. Anterior chamber depth (ACD) was measured using partial coherence laser interferometry, and IOL tilt and decentration were measured using a Purkinje meter.
Seventy eyes (35 patients) were enrolled. The mean ACD at 3 months was 4.91 mm ± 0.26 (SD) in the MICS group and 4.60 ± 0.23 mm in the SICS group. The anterior IOL shift over the first 3 months was slightly smaller with the MICS IOL (81 μm) than with the SICS IOL (254 μm). The mean ACD was 0.377 ± 178 μm deeper with the MICS IOL (P<.01, paired t test). Two years postoperatively, the amount of regeneratory PCO was higher with the MICS IOL than with the SICS IOL (image analysis software score 2.6 versus 1.9; P=.005).
Two years after surgery, the PCO rate was slightly higher with the MICS IOL. The 2 IOLs had similar performance in terms of axial stability, decentration, and tilt.

This prospective, randomized, double-masked study included 80 eyes from 40 patients. Twenty patients were implanted bilaterally with the ReSTOR +3.00-D add IOL and 20 patients were implanted bilaterally with the ReSTOR +4.00-D add IOL. Primary outcome measures were distance, intermediate, and near visual acuity. Secondary outcomes were defocus curves, best reading distance, mesopic and photopic contrast sensitivity, quality of life, and spectacle independence. Monocular and binocular visual acuity were measured as uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity at 4 m, uncorrected near and distance-corrected near visual acuity at 40 cm, and uncorrected intermediate visual acuity and distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity at 50, 60, and 70 cm.
Twelve months postoperatively, no statistically significant difference between groups in distance and near visual acuity was noted.

Randomized pilot study with intrapatient comparison.
In part 1 of this study, patients received plate-haptic IOLs (Akreos Adapt) in both eyes that were positioned vertically in 1 eye and horizontally in the other eye. In part 2, patients received a 1-piece IOL (Acrysof SA60AT) in 1 eye and a 3-piece IOL (Acrysof MA60AC) in the contralateral eye. Decentration and tilt were measured 1 month and 3 months postoperatively with a new Purkinje meter.
In part 1 (n = 15), the mean decentration of plate-haptic IOLs was 0.4 mm ± 0.2 (SD) with vertical orientation and 0.4 ± 0.2 mm with horizontal orientation and the mean tilt, 1.5 ± 1.1 degrees and 2.9 ± 0.9 degrees, respectively. In part 2 (n = 15), the mean decentration was 0.4 ± 0.3 mm with 1-piece IOLs and 0.6 ± 0.8 mm with 3-piece IOLs and the mean tilt, 2.2 ± 7.2 degrees and 5.3 ± 2.4 degrees, respectively.
Three-piece IOLs had a greater tendency toward more decentration than 1-piece IOLs, perhaps because of slight deformation of 1 or both haptics during implantation or inaccuracies in production when the haptics are manually placed into the optic. The IOL orientation for plate-haptic IOLs appeared to have no effect on IOL position. The Purkinje meter was useful in assessing the capsule bag performance of the IOLs.

Subsequently, horses are visual but markedly farsighted (hyperopic). This report describes the surgical results and visual status after phacoemulsification and implantation of IOLs in mature horses with spontaneous cataracts. Six eyes of 5 mature horses underwent phacoemulsification and implantation of a +14 diopter (D) foldable IOL. Recheck ocular examinations were performed at 1, 4 and 24 weeks post operatively. Refractive error was recorded at 4 weeks post operatively. Visual status, refractive error and anterior chamber depth were recorded 24 weeks post operatively: 5 of 6 operated eyes remained visual and the average refractive error was +0.4 ± 1.1D. There was a significant difference between the 24 week post operative refractive error and the population mean of +10D (P<0.0001) for aphakic horses. The average post operative anterior chamber depth was 7.89 ± 1.55 mm. One globe was enucleated 2 months post operatively. Phacoemulsification with IOL implantation resulted in a significant reduction in post operative refractive error and restored vision to within 0.4D of emmetropia in 5 of 6 operated eyes.

It was a perspective study. Fifty-one patients with bilateral senile cataract had implantation of a 1-piece SA60AT IOL in one eye and a 3-piece MA60BM IOL in the contralateral eye. The amount of IOL decentration, tilt, the ACD, and the degree of PCO was measured using the Pentacam Scheimpflug System 1 day and 1, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively.

There was no significant difference between the two groups in IOL decentration (t = 0.802, 0.701, 0.588, 0.898, 0.631), tilt (t = 0.199, 0.337, 0.094, 0.121, 0.248) or PCO (t = 1.214, 1.119, 1.334, 1.082, 1.517) at any time points (P > 0.05). The ACD did not change after the surgery in the 1-piece group (3.90 ± 0.99, 3.88 ± 1.07, 3.91 ± 1.01, 3.90 ± 1.02, 3.92 ± 1.02) (F = 1.333, P > 0.05) but was significantly deeper in the 3-piece group (4.37 ± 1.02, 3.90 ± 0.98, 3.95 ± 0.99, 3.93 ± 0.96, 3.97 ± 0.99) (F = 92.757, P < 0.05) one day after the operation. The ACD was more shallow in the 1-piece SA60AT group than in the 3-piece MA60BM group at all time points.

A prospective nonrandomized controlled study was conducted. Consecutively, 36 patients with senile cataract (72 eyes) received phacoemulsification and IOL implantation: 12 patients (24 eyes) were implanted with AcrySof IQ ReSTOR SN6AD3 IOL, 12 patients (24 eyes) were implanted with AcrySof IQ ReSTOR SN6AD1 IOL, and another 12 patients (24 eyes) were implanted with AcrySof IQ SN60WF as control group. All patients were assessed at 6 months postoperatively in these aspects: uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuities for distance (5 mo), intermediate (60 cm), and near (30 cm), modulation transfer function, and defocus curve. Patient satisfaction (spectacle independence, glare or halo disturbance, and overall satisfaction) was assessed by a questionnaire.
At 6 months postoperatively, both uncorrected and distance-corrected intermediate and near visual acuity were significantly better in multifocal groups than the control monofocal group (p<0.01).

380;21605352;The effectiveness of early lens extraction with intraocular lens implantation for the treatment of primary angle-closure glaucoma (EAGLE): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.;[];Trials;"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness. Although primary open-angle glaucoma is more common, primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is more likely to result in irreversible blindness. By 2020, 5·3 million people worldwide will be blind because of PACG. The current standard care for PACG is a stepped approach of a combination of laser iridotomy surgery (to open the drainage angle) and medical treatment (to reduce intraocular pressure). If these treatments fail, glaucoma surgery (eg, trabeculectomy) is indicated. It has been proposed that, because the lens of the eye plays a major role in the mechanisms leading to PACG, early clear lens extraction will improve glaucoma control by opening the drainage angle. This procedure might reduce the need for drugs and glaucoma surgery, maintain good visual acuity, and improve quality of life compared with standard care.EAGLE aims to evaluate whether early lens extraction improves patient-reported, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness, compared with standard care.
EAGLE is a multicentre pragmatic randomized trial. All people presenting to the recruitment centres in the UK and east Asia with newly diagnosed PACG and who are at least 50 years old are eligible.The primary outcomes are EQ-5D, intraocular pressure, and incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Other outcomes are: vision and glaucoma-specific patient-reported outcomes, visual acuity, visual field, angle closure, number of medications, additional surgery (e.g., trabeculectomy), costs to the health services and patients, and adverse events.A single main analysis will be done at the end of the trial, after three years of follow-up. The analysis will be based on all participants as randomized (intention to treat). 400 participants (200 in each group) will be recruited, to have 90% power at 5% significance level to detect a difference in EQ-5D score between the two groups of 0·05, and a mean difference in intraocular pressure of 1·75 mm Hg. The study will have 80% power to detect a difference of 15% in the glaucoma surgery rate.

The PCO density value, degree of IOL decentration and tilt, and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were measured using Scheimpflug videophotography 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery. Visual acuity and the number of eyes requiring neodymium:YAG laser capsulotomy were also assessed.
The study evaluated 16 eyes (63 patients). The PCO value in the hydrophilic group increased significantly with time and was statistically significantly greater than in the hydrophobic group 18 and 24 months postoperatively (both P < .001). The capsulotomy rate was statistically significantly higher in the hydrophilic group than in the hydrophobic group (P < .01).

We conducted a prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial. The LALs were implanted in eyes with axial lengths <22.20 mm and were treated with a spatial intensity profile delivered by a digital light delivery device to induce a targeted spherical and cylindrical refractive change postoperatively. Once the desired correction was achieved, the LAL was treated again to lock-in the lens power.
We studied 15 eyes of 15 patients with axial hyperopia.
The manifest refraction, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), and best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were determined with follow-up time of 12 months to determine the achieved refractive corrections and their stability.
We measured UCVA, BCVA, achieved versus targeted refractive outcome, and refractive stability with a follow-up time of 12 months.
Of 15 eyes, 14 (93%) achieved ± 0.5 diopters (D), and 10 (67%) were within ± 0.25 D of the targeted refractive adjustment up to 12 months postoperative follow-up.

Once the desired correction was achieved, the power of the IOL was locked in (ie, photo locking). The manifest refraction, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were determined 1, 6, and 12 months after lock-in to determine the achieved refractive corrections and their stability.

Case-control study.
Eyes having phacoemulsification were randomly assigned to have implantation of 1 of 3 hydrophobic acrylic IOL models. The IOLs were photographed at 0 degree and 90 degrees 1 week, 6 months, and 1 year after implantation using a Nidek EAS-1000 anterior chamber analyzer in slit mode. The images were used to determine the intensity of light scattering in the surface and middle regions of the IOL optic.
The study comprised 65 eyes of 57 patients with a mean age of 72.5 years. The rate of increase in light-scattering intensity was similar in the middle and surface regions of the Tecnis ZA9003 aspheric IOL. The increase in light-scattering intensity in both regions of the AF-1 VA-60BB spherical IOL was greater than that in the aspheric IOL at all the measurement points. The intensity of light scattering was highest and tended to increase over time in both regions of the AcrySof SA60AT spherical IOL; the rate of increase in intensity was higher in the surface region than in the middle region, and the difference was significantly greater at 6 months and 1 year than at 1 week.

Axial length measurements using the contact technique were on an average 0.27 mm shorter than those obtained using the immersion technique. Forty-two eyes (84%) had shorter axial length when measured using the contact technique as compared with the immersion technique. Lens thickness measurement by contact technique was not significantly different from that of immersion technique (3.61±0.74 and 3.60±0.67 mm, respectively; P = 0.673).

Patients scheduled for cataract surgery were randomly assigned to bilateral implantation of an aspheric AcrySof ReSTOR multifocal IOL with a +3.00 diopter (D) addition (add) or a +4.00 D add. The reading speed, critical print size, and reading acuity were measured binocularly with best correction using MNREAD acuity charts 6 months after surgery. Patients were tested with the chart at the best patient-preferred reading distance and at 40 cm. Binocular uncorrected and best distance-corrected visual acuities at far and near were also measured.
The study enrolled 32 patients. At the best reading distance, the results were similar between the 2 IOL groups in all reading parameters. When tested at 40 cm, reading speed at all print sizes from 0.3 to 0.0 (all P<.001), critical print size (P<.001), and reading acuity (P = .014) were statistically significantly better in the +3.00 D IOL group than in the +4.00 D IOL group.

For toric IOL implantation, the steepest corneal axis was determined by IOLMaster optical biometer measurement (Carl Zeiss Meditec). Three marking methods for accurate alignment of the IOL astigmatism axis to the steepest corneal axis were evaluated and compared. For method 1, the patient was seated at the surgical table and instructed to gaze at a distant target. Using a toric reference marker, the corneal limbus was marked at the 3-, 6-, and 9-o'clock positions. The goal axis was also marked using a toric axis marker. Method 2 used a horizontal slit beam for reference marking points at 3 and 9 o'clock. Method 3 was the new mapping method, in which an anterior segment photograph was used to identify several reference vessel points and axis marking points and to calculate actual lengths from the reference vessel points to the axis marking points. During surgery, the axis marking points were marked on the limbus of the eye using calipers. The accuracy of the three axis-marking methods was evaluated using anterior segment photographs.
With method 1, the average axis-marking error was 3.69±1.49°. With method 2, the average axis-marking error was 3.14±1.64°.

This study is intended to compare the prediction error and the accuracy of predictability of intraocular lens power calculation in pediatric patients at 3 month post cataract surgery with primary implantation of an intraocular lens using SRK II versus Pediatric IOL Calculator for pediatric intraocular lens calculation. Pediatric IOL Calculator is a modification of SRK II using Holladay algorithm. This program attempts to predict the refraction of a pseudophakic child as he grows, using a Holladay algorithm model. This model is based on refraction measurements of pediatric aphakic eyes. Pediatric IOL Calculator uses computer software for intraocular lens calculation.
This comparative study consists of 31 eyes (24 patients) that successfully underwent cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantations. All patients were 12 years old and below (range: 4 months to 12 years old). Patients were randomized into 2 groups; SRK II group and Pediatric IOL Calculator group using envelope technique sampling procedure. Intraocular lens power calculations were made using either SRK II or Pediatric IOL Calculator for pediatric intraocular lens calculation based on the printed technique selected for every patient. Thirteen patients were assigned for SRK II group and another 11 patients for Pediatric IOL Calculator group. For SRK II group, the predicted postoperative refraction is based on the patient's axial length and is aimed for emmetropic at the time of surgery. However for Pediatric IOL Calculator group, the predicted postoperative refraction is aimed for emmetropic spherical equivalent at age 2 years old. The postoperative refractive outcome was taken as the spherical equivalent of the refraction at 3 month postoperative follow-up. The data were analysed to compare the mean prediction error and the accuracy of predictability of intraocular lens power calculation between SRK II and Pediatric IOL Calculator.
There were 16 eyes in SRK II group and 15 eyes in Pediatric IOL Calculator group. The mean prediction error in the SRK II group was 1.03 D (SD, 0.69 D) while in Pediatric IOL Calculator group was 1.14 D (SD, 1.19 D). The SRK II group showed lower prediction error of 0.11 D compared to Pediatric IOL Calculator group, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.74). There were 3 eyes (18.75%) in SRK II group achieved accurate predictability where the refraction postoperatively was within ± 0.5 D from predicted refraction compared to 7 eyes (46.67%) in the Pediatric IOL Calculator group. However the difference of the accuracy of predictability of postoperative refraction between the two formulas was also not statistically significant (p = 0.097).
The prediction error and the accuracy of predictability of postoperative refraction in pediatric cataract surgery are comparable between SRK II and Pediatric IOL Calculator.

Phacoemulsification cataract extraction with implantation of a bag-in-the-Lens and a control IOL, the Alcon AcrySof SA60AT (Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, Texas, USA), randomized to either eye.
Axial IOL shift stimulated by physiologic (near visual effort) and pharmacologic (pilocarpine and cyclopentolate) accommodative stimulation was measured objectively with partial coherence interferometry. Other outcome measures were objective and subjective accommodation, logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution distance-corrected near visual acuity, and defocus curves.
Three months after surgery, axial IOL shift stimulated by near visual effort measured -5.9 ± 10.3 μm in bag-in-the-lens eyes versus -8.4 ± 12.8 μm in control eyes (P = .37), that stimulated by pilocarpine measured 20.2 ± 165.6 μm versus 50.4 ± 164.4 μm (P = .36), and that stimulated by cyclopentolate measured -65.8 ± 64.3 μm versus -54.0 ± 37.5 μm (P = .34), respectively (n = 25). Objective accommodation measured 0.03 ± 0.18 diopters (D) in bag-in-the-lens eyes versus 0.08 ± 0.21 D in control eyes (P = .40), whereas subjective accommodation measured 2.48 ± 0.72 D versus 2.45 ± 0.80 D (P = .75), respectively. Distance-corrected near visual acuity and defocus curves showed no difference between IOLs.
The bag-in-the-lens IOL demonstrated negligible axial shift and objective accommodation with physiologic near visual stimulation.

Forty-two eyes of 21 cataract surgery patients were randomized to undergo implantation with either a silicone diffractive multifocal IOL (Tecnis ZM900, Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA, USA) or an acrylic diffractive multifocal IOL (Tecnis ZMA00, AMO). The two IOLs share the same design platform. Outcome measurements included uncorrected and best-corrected distance and near visual acuity, spherical equivalent, reading speed and reading acuity, as well as photic phenomena. Patients were followed for 6 months following surgery.
The mean spherical equivalent was 0.161 D (acrylic) and 0.065 D (silicone). The mean uncorrected visual acuity was 0.17 logMAR for the acrylic eyes and 0.17 logMAR for the silicone eyes, a difference of 0.01 (p=0.861). The mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.08 for the acrylic eyes and 0.10 for the silicone lens, a difference of 0.03 (p=0.321).

At most distances, the mean visual acuity in the multifocal IOL groups decreased in proportion to the added astigmatism. With astigmatism of 0.00 D and 0.50 D, distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) in the +4.00 D group and distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) and DCNVA in the +3.00 D group were significantly better than in the monofocal group; the corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was similar.

In a prospective study the new ReSTOR +3 D was compared to the former ReSTOR platform with 4 D near addition. A total of 40 patients received 1 of these 2 multifocal lenses bilaterally in both eyes after uneventful phacoemulsification in otherwise sound cataract eyes (20 patients ReSTOR +3 D, 20 patients ReSTOR + 4D). After 3 months the following parameters were assessed: uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity, near vision at different distances, contrast sensitivity, defocus curve and anterior and posterior segments. The functional tests were performed monocularly and binocularly.
Uncorrected binocular distance visual acuity (decimal) was 0.93 (logMAR 0.03 ± 0.12) in the ReSTOR +3 D group and 1.05 (-0.02 ± 0.1) in the ReSTOR +4 D group. In the intermediate distance the ReSTOR +3 D performed slightly better at 40 cm (0.68 versus 0.56) (logMAR 0.17 ± 0.14 versus 0.24 ± 0.18). The difference was significant (p<0.01) at 70 cm (0.69 versus 0.43) (logMAR 0.16 ± 0.27 vs 0.37 ± 0.2).

Post hoc analysis of retro-illumination images from a previous multicentre, contralateral eye study was used to assess intraocular lens (IOL) position and rotational stability for up to 24 months postoperatively. The image of IOL and capsular bag enabled any rotation to be calculated by measuring the angle from the horizontal to an arbitrary point on the IOL edge. The difference between the angle at the first and subsequent visits was subtracted to give a measure of IOL rotational stability.
Data were collected from 64 eyes fitted with the Akreos IOL and 58 eyes fitted with the AcrySof IOL. Mean (SD) absolute rotation values for the two IOLs were small over the 2-year period, ranging from 2.53 degrees (2.40 degrees) to 3.2 degrees (2.57 degrees) with Akreos Adapt and 2.67 degrees (2.22 degrees) to 3.33 degrees (3.06 degrees) with AcrySof SA60AT at 6 and 24 months, respectively.

Keio University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.
Corneal and ocular higher-order aberrations (HOAs) were analyzed preoperatively and postoperatively in eyes having cataract extraction with aspheric IOL implantation. The predicted postoperative total spherical aberration Z(4,0) was calculated by adding the preoperative corneal spherical aberration and the labeled spherical aberration of the IOL. The prediction error of the postoperative total spherical aberration was calculated by subtracting the predicted postoperative total spherical aberration from the postoperative total spherical aberration. Surgically induced corneal spherical aberration was calculated by subtracting the postoperative from the preoperative corneal spherical aberration.
There were no statistically significant differences between preoperative and postoperative corneal spherical aberration, 3rd-order aberration, or HOAs. The prediction error of the postoperative total spherical aberration was within +/-0.05 microm in 9 (24.3%) of the 37 eyes evaluated and within +/-0.10 microm in 18 eyes (48.6%). Statistically significantly correlations were found between the surgically induced corneal spherical aberration and prediction error of postoperative total spherical aberration, the preoperative corneal spherical aberration and surgically induced corneal spherical aberration, and the preoperative corneal spherical aberration and prediction error of postoperative total spherical aberration.

Laboratory of Experimental Ophthalmology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.
An aspheric IOL was implanted in 1 eye and a spherical IOL in the other eye of patients with bilateral age-related cataract. Contrast sensitivity was measured using 2 computerized tests (vertical sine-modulated gratings and circular sine-modulated patterns) with cycloplegia and a 5.0 mm artificial pupil under photopic conditions at optimum refractive correction and at several defocus levels. The depth of focus and the myopic shift (shift of optimum focus toward more myopic values at lower spatial frequencies) were determined. Higher-order aberrations were assessed using a Hartmann-Shack wavefront analyzer; straylight was measured with a straylight meter.
In the 60 eyes evaluated, there were no statistically significant differences in contrast sensitivity measured at optimum focus, depth of focus, or straylight between the 2 IOLs. The mean spherical aberration was significantly lower with the aspheric IOL (-0.036 microm) than with the spherical IOL (0.064 microm) (P<.001) and the mean myopic shift, statistically significantly smaller (0.05 diopter [D] and -0.47 D, respectively) (P<.001).
Eyes with the aspheric IOL had lower spherical aberration than eyes with the spherical IOL and, related to that, a smaller myopic shift. No significant differences were found between the 2 IOLs in contrast sensitivity measured at optimum focus, depth of focus, or straylight.

461;19628740;Augmentation of macular pigment following implantation of blue light-filtering intraocular lenses at the time of cataract surgery.;[];Investigative ophthalmology & visual science;"(Photo)-oxidative stress is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), with the threshold for retinal damage being lowest for short-wavelength (blue) light. Macular pigment (MP), consisting of the carotenoids lutein (L), zeaxanthin (Z) and meso-Z, has a maximum absorption at 460 nm and protects the retina from (photo)-oxidative injury. This study was designed to investigate whether the blue light-filtering properties of the Alcon AcrySof Natural intraocular lens (ANIOL) implanted during cataract surgery affects MP optical density (MPOD).
Forty-two patients scheduled for cataract surgery were recruited for the study. These patients all had a preoperative best corrected visual acuity rating (BCVAR) of at least 0.5 (logMAR) in the study eye. The patients were randomized to have either the standard Alcon AcrySof three-piece acrylic intraocular lens (AIOL) (controls) or the ANIOL implanted at the time of cataract surgery. The spatial profile of MPOD (i.e., at 0.25 degrees, 0.5 degrees, 1.0 degrees, and 1.75 degrees eccentricity) was measured with customized heterochromatic flicker photometry (cHFP) 1 week before and 1 week after surgery, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Serum concentrations of L and Z were also measured at each study visit.
There was a highly significant and positive correlation between all MPODs (e.g., at 0.25 degrees) recorded 1 week before and after surgery in eyes with an AIOL implant (r = 0.915, P < 0.01; paired samples t-test, P = 0.631) and in those ANIOL implants (r = 0.868, P < 0.01; paired samples t-test, P = 0.719). Average MPOD across the retina increased significantly with time (after 3 months) in the ANIOL group (repeated-measures, general linear model, P < 0.05), but remained stable in the AIOL group (repeated-measures, general linear model, P > 0.05). There were no significant time or lens effects observed for serum L over the study period (P > 0.05). There was a significant time effect for serum Z over the study period (P < 0.05), but not a significant time/lens interaction (P > 0.05).
Customized HFP can reliably measure the MPOD spatial profile in the presence of lens opacity, and cataract surgery does not artifactually alter MPOD readings. This study also provides evidence that implanting an IOL that filters blue light is associated with augmentation of MPOD in the absence of raised serum concentrations of L and Z. However, further and longitudinal study is needed to assess whether the observed increase in MPOD after implantation of blue-filtering IOLs is associated with reduced risk of AMD development and/or progression.";;;"There was a highly significant and positive correlation between all MPODs (e.g., at 0.25 degrees) recorded 1 week before and after surgery in eyes with an AIOL implant (r = 0.915, P < 0.01; paired samples t-test, P = 0.631) and in those ANIOL implants (r = 0.868, P < 0.01; paired samples t-test, P = 0.719).

475;19384780;Late postoperative opacification of hydrogel intraocular lenses: analysis of 13 explanted lenses.;[];Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde;"We report the clinical, morphological, and ultrastructural findings of 13 consecutively explanted opacified Hydroview(R) (hydrogel) intraocular lenses (IOLs). Our purpose was to provide a comprehensive account on the possible factors involved in late postoperative opacification of these IOLs.
Thirteen consecutive opacified hydrogel IOLs (Hydroview H 60 M, Bausch & Lomb) were explanted due to the significant visual impairment they caused. The IOLs underwent macroscopical examination, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and electrophoresis for protein detection. Three unused control Hydroview IOLs served for comparison.
Macroscopical examination showed a diffuse or localized grey-whitish opacification within the IOL optic. TEM confirmed the presence of lesions inside the optic in all the explanted IOLs and revealed 3 patterns of deep deposits: a) diffuse, thick, granular, electron-dense ones; b) small, thin, lattice-like ones, with prominent electron-lucent areas; and c) elongated electron-dense formations surrounded by electron-lucent halos. SEM showed surface deposits on four IOLs. EDS revealed oxygen and carbon in all IOLs and documented calcium, phosphorus, silicon and/or iron in the deposits. Two of the patients with iron in their IOLs had eye surgery prior to their phacoemulsification. Iron correlated well with the second TEM pattern of deep lesions, whereas calcium with the third TEM pattern. No protein bands were detected on electrophoresis. Control lenses did not show any ultrastructural or chemical abnormality.
The present study supports the presence of chemical alterations inside the polymer of the optic in late postoperative opacification of Hydroview IOLs. This opacification does not follow a unique pathway but may present under different ultrastructular patterns depending on the responsible factors. Mechanical stress during surgery may initiate a sequence of events where ions such as calcium, phosphorus, silicon, and/or iron, participate in a biochemical cascade that leads to gradual alteration of the polymer network. Intraocular inflammation due to previous operation may be a factor inducing opacification through increase of iron-binding capacity in the aqueous humour. Calcification accounts only partially for the opacification noted in this type of IOL.";;;"Macroscopical examination showed a diffuse or localized grey-whitish opacification within the IOL optic.

The blue-light-filtering IOLs had worse contrast acuity (P = 0.0004) and foveal threshold (P = 0.008) compared with the UV-filtering IOLs. Color vision tests and high-contrast visual acuity did not show any statistically significant differences between IOLs (P>0.05).

OEA methodology was verified by demonstrating that the results of clinical performance simulations were consistent with previously published clinical performance data using the same types of IOLs. From these results we conclude that the OEA method can objectively simulate the potential clinical trial performance of IOLs.;;;;;10.1364/ol.34.000007;2008-12-26;[{'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Huawei', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Advanced Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA 92705-4933, USA. huawei.zhao@amo-inc.com'}]

Spherical aberration (SA), coma, trefoil, and RMS of higher order aberrations (HOAs) were analysed for 4.0 and 6.0 mm optical zones. Best-corrected visual acuities (BCVAs), contrast sensitivity under photopic and mesopic conditions, and modulation transfer function (MTF) were evaluated to compare visual performances.
The mean internal SA was -0.06/-0.35 microm in the aspheric IOL group and 0.04/0.17 microm in the spherical IOL group (at 4 mm/6 mm pupil). Total SA was near to zero in the aspheric IOL group, and was 0.11+/-0.034/0.48+/-0.13 microm in the spherical IOL group. The internal Z(3)(-1) and total Z(3)(-1) were more negative in the spherical IOL group. The internal Z(3)(-3) was more negative in the aspheric IOL group. The two groups were similar in terms of other Zernike values and RMS of HOA. There were no differences in BCVA between groups.

We prospectively examined 69 eyes of 40 consecutive patients with myopic refractive errors of -3.25 to -22.75 diopters (D) who were undergoing ICL implantation. We assessed the amplitude of accommodation using an accommodometer before and one, three, six, and 12 months after surgery. We also investigated its relationship with patient age.
The accommodation was 6.36 +/- 3.94 D (mean +/- standard deviation) before surgery and 4.89 +/- 2.72 D, 4.98 +/- 2.67 D, 5.16 +/- 2.72 D, and 5.72 +/- 2.85 D at one, three, six, and 12 months after surgery, respectively. The variance of data was statistically significant (P = .02, repeated-measures analysis of variance). Multiple comparisons demonstrated significant differences between measurements made before surgery and at one month after (P = .004, Fisher least significant difference test), before surgery and at three months after (P = .007), and before surgery and at six months after (P = .01).

Department of Ophthalmology, Queen Mary's Hospital, London, United Kingdom.
Sixty-three patients having cataract surgery were randomized to receive US phacoemulsification or AquaLase liquefaction cataract surgery. Macular thickness and volume were evaluated by OCT preoperatively and 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively. The primary outcomes were OCT central macular thickness and best corrected visual acuity at 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes were OCT macular volume and perioperative and postoperative complications.
Over the 6-week study, the median increase in foveal thickness in the study eye compared with that in the fellow eye was 11 microm (interquartile range [IQR] -21 to 23 microm) in the AquaLase group and 17 microm (IQR -11 to 33 microm) in the phacoemulsification group (P = .229). A subgroup analysis of diabetic patients found a median increase in foveal thickness in the study eye versus the fellow eye of 2 microm (IQR -14 to 23 microm) in the AquaLase group and 29 microm (IQR 11 to 41 microm) in the phacoemulsification group (P = .07).

ReSTOR, a new multi-focal intraocular lens (IOL) addresses this issue with an improvement in both distance and near vision, often without need for glasses. This analysis attempted to discuss the patient-reported benefit of ReSTOR using a full but organised representation of data.
Two non-randomised, open-label clinical trials conducted in Europe and the United-States were conducted to compare the efficacy of ReSTOR to AcrySof mono-focal IOLs. A total of 710 patients in need of bilateral cataract extraction were included in the pooled study. The TyPE, a patient questionnaire, was fully completed by 672 of them before and after each eye surgery. The TyPE, composed of 67 items measuring overall visual functioning in both conditions (with and without wearing glasses), evaluates limitations, troubles and satisfaction in distance and near vision. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the TyPE questionnaire was performed on pooled data from baseline and post-surgery observations in order to fully represent the change in the TyPE data over time. ReSTOR and mono-focal groups were used as illustrative variables. The coordinates of the first 2 factors were compared between visits and between IOLs (ReSTOR vs. mono-focal), using paired t-tests and t-tests, respectively.
The first factor of the PCA explained 55% of the variance and represented 'visual functioning and patient satisfaction'. The second factor explained 6% of the variance and was interpreted as 'independence from glasses'. An overall difference in factorial coordinates in both factors was seen between baseline and the first eye surgery, and between the first and the second eye surgery. No difference between ReSTOR and mono-focal IOL groups was observed at baseline. After surgery, ReSTOR treated-patients had higher coordinates on both ""visual functioning and satisfaction"" and ""independence from glasses"" factors. Findings observed on the factorial plan were supported by statistical comparisons of factorial coordinates.

Randomized clinical trial.
Sixty patients, recruited from our outpatient department, were assigned randomly to receive an ultraviolet-filter IOL (clear IOL group) or a blue light-filter IOL (yellow IOL group) combined with a vitreoretinal procedure. Main outcome measures were intraoperative conditions for the surgeon and the functional outcome. Second outcome measures were complication rates and vitreoretinal diagnoses.
The questionnaire responses showed that the blue light-filter IOLs did not represent an impediment to vitreoretinal surgery (P>.05). No intraoperative complications were encountered in either group. Patients in both IOL groups showed comparable functional results with respect to visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, color vision, and glare effect (P>.05). The functional outcome was influenced significantly by the vitreoretinal diagnosis (P<.01).

The LMI was implanted in patients with bilateral macular pathology and visual acuity worse than 20/200 in whom vision improved with a x2.5 external telescope preoperatively. The LMI was implanted after conventional phacoemulsification or microphakonit. The minimum follow-up was 6 months.
Six eyes of 6 patients had surgery in the worse eye. Four eyes had ARMD, and 1 eye each had myopic macular degeneration or macular dystrophy. There were no intraoperative complications. The mean gain in distance acuity was 3.66 lines +/- 1.88 (SD), and the mean increase in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study score for near acuity was 50.83 +/- 9.15 logMAR. The best corrected distance acuity and near acuity improved significantly (both P = .014). The mean change in endothelial count was -5.79% +/- -4.07%. The mean postoperative corneal endothelial-LMI distance was 3.15 +/- 0.31 mm. A good central fundus view was possible around the mirrors in all eyes.

Prospective, comparative, and interventional case series.
SettingSingle-centre institutional practice. This prospective study evaluated 58 patients with cataracts who underwent bimanual microphaco cataract surgery in both eyes. A ThinOptX lens was introduced into one eye and an Alcon Acrysof lens, as a control, into the other. One month after cataract surgery, the corneal, whole-eye, and internal spherical aberration, and contrast sensitivity in both eyes were measured. We also measured the spherical aberration in artificial model eyes bearing Acrysof and ThinOptX lenses. Two-sided paired t-test was used for assessing all data.
The root mean square (RMS) for both whole-eye and internal spherical aberrations was smaller in eyes bearing ThinOptX (P=0.03 and P=0.07, respectively). Although there was no statistically significant difference in the RMS for internal spherical aberration between ThinOptX- and Acrysof-bearing eyes, according to the Zernike polynomial expansion, all human and model eyes bearing ThinOptX registered negative internal spherical aberration in Z(4,0) and Z(6,0). On the other hand, all human and model eyes bearing Acrysof registered positive internal spherical aberration in Z(4,0) and Z(6,0). The ThinOptX lens yielded slightly higher contrast sensitivity in all cycles.

Prospective, randomized, double-masked clinical trial.
Ninety patients presenting for cataract surgery to the Department of Ophthalmology, Hillingdon Hospital were randomized to receive the 1CU accommodative IOL, a multifocal IOL, or a monofocal IOL (control group).
Patients underwent bilateral sequential phacoemulsification with implantation of 1 of the 3 IOL types and were assessed at 3 and 18 months after second-eye surgery.
Logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution distance and near visual acuities (VAs) (unaided and distance corrected), contrast sensitivity, and accommodative amplitude (near point and defocusing) were measured at 3 and 18 months. Reading speed was assessed at 18 months, and glare symptoms and spectacle independence were compared using a standardized questionnaire.
Mean unaided and distance-corrected binocular near VAs were similar in the 1CU and multifocal and were significantly higher than the control group's (P<0.02). There was no significant difference in reading speed between any of the groups, but critical print sizes were similar in the 1CU and multifocal groups and significantly better than the control group's (P = 0.02). The accommodative range was highest in the multifocal group and lowest in the control group, and there was no significant difference between the 1CU and control groups for defocus or near point at 18 months.

This study comprised 80 patients, 20 each from 4 university hospital centers in Sweden. All patients had bilateral clear corneal phacoemulsification with implantation of an Akreos Adapt AO IOL in 1 eye and Tecnis Z9000 IOL in the other eye according to a randomization protocol. Preoperatively, 90% contrast Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity was measured and the mesopic pupil sizes were determined.

Eleven myopic patients were randomly selected to have implantation of a Verisyse pIOL in 1 eye and an Artiflex pIOL in the other. Using a 2-dimensional image, dynamic measurements of the relationship between the anterior surface of the pIOL and the corneal endothelium, the posterior surface of the pIOL and the anterior surface of the crystalline lens, and the pupil diameter were performed using Visante OCT. Physiological accommodation was stimulated by adding lenses in 1.00 diopter (D) steps from +1.00 to -7.00 D.
Both groups had a significant decrease in pupil diameter (P<.0001, generalized linear model [GLM]) and in the distance between the anterior surface of the pIOL and the corneal endothelium (P<.0001, GLM) with accommodation.

Monocular and binocular testing four to six months after surgery included uncorrected and best-spectacle corrected visual acuity at distance, intermediate, and near vision; mesopic contrast sensitivity function with and without glare; and quality-of-life and vision surveys six months after surgery.
Monocular testing showed that eyes with Crystalens accommodating IOL had statistically better best-spectacle corrected distance, uncorrected and distance-corrected intermediate, and best-corrected near vision.

A rural hospital in India.
This was a prospective randomized double-masked fellow-eye controlled study. Over a 4-month period, 118 patients with normal eyes apart from age-related cataract were randomized to receive a square-edged or round-edged PMMA IOL in the first eye. The IOLs were identical apart from the edge profile. The fellow-eye had implantation of the alternative IOL within 1 month. Retroillumination images of the posterior capsule were taken using a dedicated camera system and analyzed to quantify the PCO area using POCO software 1 and 2 years postoperatively and the PCO area and severity using POCOman semiqualitative software at 2 years. Visual acuity was measured using a Gujarati logMAR chart.
One hundred fifteen patients were available for examination at 1 year and 107 at 2 years. With POCO software, the PCO area was reduced in the square-edged IOL group at 1 year (median 30% versus 20%, P=.001) and at 2 years (median 45% versus 35%, P=.006). With POCOman, the PCO area and severity were reduced in the square-edged group at 2 years (median 41.5% versus 33.2%, P=.019 and 0.59 versus 0.46, P=.037, respectively). There was no significant difference in visual acuity between the 2 groups at 1 or 2 years.
Sophisticated image analysis techniques can be used in developing countries to quantify PCO. Using extracapsular surgery, square-edged PMMA IOLs reduced the PCO area and severity compared with an identical round-edged IOL; however, the differences were not as marked as those reported with phacoemulsification. This may be due to the difficulty of performing a capsulorhexis that lies on the IOL surface in this situation. Nevertheless, square-edged IOLs offer a potential benefit for extracapsular surgery in the developing world.";;;One hundred fifteen patients were available for examination at 1 year and 107 at 2 years.

A sutureless iris-fixed ciliary sulcus implantation of a posterior chamber IOL (Binder-IOL, Fa. Iolution, Itzehoe) designed especially for such cases represents an alternative.
At the end of both haptics of this IOL, with a 6 mm optic zone, a T-shaped anchor is mounted at an angle of 45 degrees from the optical plane. These anchors are inserted from behind the iris into peripheral iridotomies performed preoperatively with a YAG-laser or intraoperatively with a vitrectomy cutter. The long, C-shaped haptics are thus secured in the ciliary sulcus.
After slight modification of the technique, the implantation can be performed securely and reproducibly. In the 22 implantations performed to date, the IOL was well centered and stable, even in cases with only residual iris stroma. If the iridotomies are been performed too centrally, an ovalisation of the pupil may occur. No further side effects have been observed.

Ray tracing analysis and lens design; finite element modeling of biomechanical properties; cadaver eye implantation; initial clinical evaluation.
Ray tracing analysis indicated that a dual-optic design with a high plus-power front optic coupled to an optically compensatory minus posterior optic produced greater change in conjugation power of the eye compared to that produced by axial movement of a single-optic IOL, and that magnification effects were unlikely to account for improved near vision. Finite element modeling indicated that the two optics can be linked by spring-loaded haptics that allow anterior and posterior axial displacement of the front optic in response to changes in ciliary body tone and capsular tension. A dual-optic single-piece foldable silicone lens was constructed based on these principles. Subsequent initial clinical evaluation in 24 human eyes after phacoemulsification for cataract indicated mean 3.22 diopters of accommodation (range, 1 to 5 D) based on defocus curve measurement. Accommodative amplitude evaluation at 1- and 6-month follow-up in all eyes indicated that the accommodative range was maintained and that the lens was well tolerated.

At 3 months, contrast sensitivity was measured using the CSV-1000E contrast sensitivity chart test face (Vector Vision) at 3, 6, 12, and 18 cycles per degrees (cpd) under photopic conditions (85 cd/m(2)) and mesopic conditions (2.7 cd/m(2)) with 4.0 mm and 6.0 mm fixed central apertures, with and without glare. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used and a pair-wise comparison performed. The main outcome measure was the difference in contrast sensitivity between IOLs at each spatial frequency.
The best corrected visual acuity was similar between the 3 IOL groups (P = .6). The AcrySof IQ group had significantly higher contrast sensitivity at 18 cpd under photopic conditions (P = .008); at 3, 6, 12, and 18 cpd during mesopic testing with a 4.0 mm aperture without glare (P = .018, P = .011, P = .007, and P = .0001, respectively) and with glare (P = .003, P = .006, P = .005, and P = .004, respectively); and at all spatial frequencies during mesopic testing with a 6.0 mm aperture without glare (P = .018, P = .006, P = .009, and P = .0001, respectively) and with glare (P = .019, P = .002, P = .01, and P = .017, respectively).

As blocking blue light may be to the patient's detriment, this study was designed to evaluate visual function following implantation of a blue-blocking (Acrysof Natural) IOL.
Patients were recruited for this non-randomized controlled interventional study, from those attending a private rural ophthalmology clinic for cataract surgery (n = 93). Only those who had previously had a conventional IOL implanted into one eye were offered an Acrysof Natural IOL for the second eye. Postoperatively patients underwent refracted Snellen visual acuity, contrast sensitivity using a CSV-1000E instrument and colour vision testing using a Farnsworth D-15 test, with a subset (n = 20) undergoing a Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test. Results were then compared between eyes. Finally, a subset (n = 63) completed a survey designed to assess the subjective impact of the Acrysof Natural IOL.
There were no statistically significant differences between eyes implanted with conventional IOLs compared with Acrysof Natural IOLs for visual acuity (t = 0.57; P = 0.57), contrast sensitivity (t = 0.43; P = 0.67 for 3 cycles per degree [cpd], t = 0.56; P = 0.58 for 6 cpd, t = 0.09; P = 0.93 for 12 cpd and t = 0.16; P = 0.87 for 18 cpd) or colour vision with the Farnsworth D-15 (Chi(2) = 0.38; P = 0.55) or the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test t = 0.34; P = 0.74).

The RMS (excluding tilt and defocus) did not change in the AcrySof IQ group and increased significantly in the Tecnis group with the 10.0 mm and 5.0 mm pupil diameters. Spherical aberration and coma-like terms did not change significantly; however, vertical astigmatism, vertical trefoil, and vertical tetrafoil changed significantly with surgery with the 10.0 mm and 5.0 mm pupil diameters (P<.0005). The induced wave aberration pattern for 3rd- and higher-order aberrations consistently showed a superior lobe, resulting from a combination of positive vertical trefoil (Z(3)(-3)) and negative tetrafoil (Z(4)(4)). The mean vertical astigmatism increased by 2.47 microm +/- 1.49 (SD) and 1.74 +/- 1.44 microm, vertical trefoil increased by 1.81 +/- 1.19 microm and 1.20 +/- 1.34 microm, and tetrafoil increased by -1.10 +/- 0.78 microm and -0.89 +/- 0.68 microm in the Tecnis group and AcrySof IQ group, respectively. There were no significant differences between the corneal aberrations in the 2 postoperative groups, although there was a tendency toward more terms or orders changing statistically significantly in the Tecnis group, which had slightly higher amounts of induced aberrations.
Cataract surgery with a small superior incision induced consistent and significant changes in several corneal Zernike terms (vertical astigmatism, trefoil, and tetrafoil), resulting in a significantly increased overall corneal RMS wavefront error. These results can be used to improve predictions of optical performance with new IOL designs using computer eye models and identify the potentially different impact of incision strategies on cataract surgery.";;;"The RMS (excluding tilt and defocus) did not change in the AcrySof IQ group and increased significantly in the Tecnis group with the 10.0 mm and 5.0 mm pupil diameters.

Twenty patients (40 eyes) were randomly divided in 2 equal groups to bilaterally receive the aspherical Tecnis Z9000 IOL (AMO) or the spherical CeeOn Edge 911 IOL (AMO). Contrast sensitivity was measured and ocular wavefront analysis performed before surgery and 6 months after. Patients completed the Activities of Daily Vision Scale (ADVS) to evaluate patient-centered visual outcomes. Other examinations included refraction before and after mydriasis and pupil diameter.
The mean postoperative best corrected visual acuity (logMAR) was 0.03 +/- 0.05 (SD) in the Tecnis group and 0.01 +/- 0.05 in the CeeOn Edge group (P = .41). Refractive evaluation with mydriasis showed a mean myopic shift as low as -0.02 +/- 0.36 diopter (D) in the Tecnis group and -0.51 +/- 0.37 D in the CeeOn Edge group (P = .001). Mesopic contrast sensitivity at high spatial frequencies was significantly better in the Tecnis group (P<.001), while contrast sensitivity under photopic and glare conditions was not different between the 2 groups.

21 eyes with subluxation of the IOL were treated with iris sutures for refixation. The operation was performed under topical and intracameral anaesthesia. Refixation was achieved by suturing one or both haptics to one or two fixation points in the outer periphery of the iris. Complete zonular dialysis made it necessary to suture at two fixation spots. All eyes were examined preoperatively, at one day and three months postoperatively considering functional results and postoperative IOL centration.

Standard phacoemulsification with implantation of hydrophobic acrylic IOLs (""yellow"" HOYA AF-1 YA60BB n = 63, Alcon MA 60AC n = 52, AMO AR 40e n = 131) was performed in 246 consecutive patients (first eyes). The ""yellow"" AF-1 YA60BB was mainly implanted in eyes with macular drusen, whereas the other two IOL types were selected statistically. Eyes with no guaranteed postoperative follow-up and eyes with previous surgical interventions were excluded. Beside a complete ophthalmological examination, biometry (IOLMaster, Zeiss) and objective refraction (Nidek) were assessed. IOL power was predicted according to the Holladay-I formula and with the IOL-specific constants provided by the manufacturer. The objective refraction was evaluated again four to six weeks after cataract surgery. The ""predictive error"" (PE) and the absolute value of PE (APE) were defined as the deviation of the postoperative objective refraction to the target refraction.
Mean target refraction of the 246 eyes was - 0.54 +/- 0.68 D and PE was - 0.24 +/- 0.75 D (APE: 0.57 D). With the MA 60AC a PE/APE of - 0.24 +/- 0.71 D/0.59 D was achieved.

A secondary objective was to establish the relationship between uncorrected visual acuity and patient-reported outcomes.
This was a prospective non-randomized, open-label clinical trial consisting of 339 patients bilaterally implanted with the AD-IOL and 156 bilaterally implanted with the CM-IOL. The outcomes of both groups were assessed 6 months postoperatively after second eye implantation. Assessed endpoints included patient-reported outcomes and visual acuity. Limitations of this study include the lack of random assignment to treatment groups and lack of masking of both the physicians and patients.
AD-IOL patients demonstrated significantly better uncorrected near visual acuity (UCNVA) compared to CM-IOL patients (0.02 versus 0.41 log MAR [logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution], respectively; p < 0.0001).

Department of Ophthalmology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
Forty eyes of 20 patients were randomized to implantation of an aspherical IOL (Tecnis Z9000, AMO) in 1 eye and a spherical IOL (Sensar AR40e, AMO) in the other eye. Three to 4 months postoperatively, photopic HCVA (270 cd/m(2)) was measured with the observer-independent Frankfurt-Freiburg Contrast and Acuity Test System (FF-CATS) and high-mesopic HCVA and LCVA (8 cd/m(2)) were measured with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts. CS was assessed with the FF-CATS under photopic (167 cd/m(2)), high-mesopic (1.67 cd/m(2)), and low-mesopic (0.167 cd/m(2)) luminance conditions with and without glare. For each individual eye, higher-order wavefront aberrations were reconstructed for a physiological mesopic pupil diameter. Intraindividual differences (Delta(i)) in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and higher-order aberrations (HOAs) were calculated, and the influence of age and Delta(i) HOA on Delta(i) contrast sensitivity (logCS) under high-mesopic conditions was investigated using multiple regression analysis.
There were no statistically significant differences between the Tecnis IOL and the Sensar IOL in visual acuity measurements or contrast sensitivity measurements. For physiological mesopic pupil diameter, primary spherical aberration (Z(4)(0)) was significantly lower in the Tecnis group (P<.001).

A portable Colvard pupillometer was used to measure pupil diameters before and after surgery under two different light conditions: one with scotopic surroundings with absolute darkness in the examination room and the other maximal simulated photopic surroundings, caused by the instillation of a pilocarpine 2% drug until a nonreactive myosis could be observed. Under such light conditions, both the horizontal and vertical pupil motion ranges were measured. Measures were then sorted into five temporal segments in order to have enough samples per temporal segment for a cohesive data analysis. Mean values and confidence intervals were then derived per temporal segment according to Student's law. Constraints on the pupil motion range were identified.

Prospective nonrandomized trial.
Fifty-four eyes of 33 patients with myopia (mean, -9.67 diopters [D]) and astigmatism (mean, -3.44 D).
The enclavation site was marked on the limbus using the Javal keratometer. The Artisan toric phakic IOL was implanted according to the axis marked on the limbus. Follow-up was a minimum of 6 months.
Safety index, efficacy index, predictability, safety, and vector analysis of total refractive correction were determined. The effects of axis misalignment and incision-induced astigmatism on the final refractive error were evaluated.
At 6 months after surgery, the safety index was 1.29+/-0.29 and the efficacy index was 1.04+/-0.35. Mean spherical equivalent subjective refraction reduced from -11.39+/-4.86 D before surgery to -0.38+/-0.57 D at 6 months. Sixty-seven percent of eyes were within 0.50 D of attempted refraction and 89% were within 1.00 D. Mean preoperative cylinder was 2.92+/-1.60 D at 91.4 degrees . At 6 months, the mean cylinder was 0.28+/-0.54 D at 174.3 degrees . No eyes lost 2 or more lines of best-corrected visual acuity at 6 months. Eighty-three percent of eyes achieved uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 and 28% achieved 20/20. Vector analysis of total surgically induced astigmatism revealed a mean cylindrical change of 3.21+/-1.71 D. Average axis misalignment was 0.37+/-5.34 degrees . The mean incision-induced astigmatism was 0.74+/-0.61 D at 0.2 degrees .
Implantation of the myopic toric IOL leads to safe, efficacious, and predictable results. The level of unpredictability caused by minor axis IOL misalignment has minimal effects on the residual refractive error. The procedure of axis alignment with the Javal keratometer seems to be an accurate method of marking the eye for toric IOL implantation. Incision-induced astigmatism can result in an overcorrection of the cylinder. A systematic undercorrection of -0.50 D for attempted cylindrical outcome could result in an achieved correction closer to emmetropia.";;;At 6 months after surgery, the safety index was 1.29+/-0.29 and the efficacy index was 1.04+/-0.35.

Thus, long term clinical evaluation of new implants is important.
As part of a prospective, non-randomised FDA trial, the Rayner Centerflex, a foldable hydrophilic acrylic, single piece IOL was implanted in one eye of 83 patients (mean age 73.5 (SD 7.0) years). Over 3 years postoperatively, a standardised FDA protocol concerning IOL safety and efficacy was followed including evaluation of spherical equivalent (SE), best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA), endothelial cell count (ECC), flare meter values, PCO development, and anterior capsule shrinkage.
Postoperatively, mean SE was stable ranging between -0.3D and 0.17D. After 1-2 months, all patients achieved a BCDVA of 20/40 or better. At 3-6 months postoperatively, mean ECC decreased from 2612 (SD 346) cells/mm2 to 2380 (316) cells/mm2.

Sri Sankaradeva Nethralaya, Guwahati, India.
This prospective randomized parallel group single-center patient-masked examiner-masked study comprised 26 eyes of 13 healthy patients with bilateral age-related cataract.

28 participants were implanted monocularly with a KH-3500 ""accommodative"" IOL and 20 controls with a Softec1 IOL. Outcome measures of refraction, visual acuity, subjective amplitude of accommodation, objective accommodative stimulus response curve, aberrometry, and Scheimpflug imaging were taken at approximately 3 weeks and repeated after 6 months.
Best corrected acuity with the KH-3500 was 0.06 (SD 0.13) logMAR at distance and 0.58 (0.20) logMAR at near. Accommodation was 0.39 (0.53) D measured objectively and 3.1 (1.6) D subjectively. Higher order aberrations were 0.87 (0.85) microm and lower order were 0.24 (0.39) microm. Posterior subcapsular light scatter was 0.95% (1.37%) greater than IOL clarity. In comparison, all control group measures were similar except objective (0.17 (0.13) D; p = 0.032) and subjective (2.0 (0.9) D; p = 0.009) amplitude of accommodation.

This study was conducted in two parts. The first part was a randomized open study of 32 eyes of 16 patients who underwent bilateral phacoemulsification with a foldable IOL in the capsular bag. A Tecnis Z9000 IOL was implanted in one eye and an Acrysof MA60BM IOL in the fellow eye.

We investigated the rotational stability of eyes during standardized photography and recommend two methods for an enhanced evaluation of tIOL rotation.
1. The cyclorotation of the eye was investigated using standard fundus photography. A sequence of two fundus photographic slides was taken in 550 phakic eyes of 275 consecutive patients with a time interval of at least 6 months. With characteristic markers on the fundus photograph, the axial orientation of the eyes was defined and the cyclorotation between the two slides of each eye was measured. 2. Using bifocal photography (HRA II - Heidelberg Retina Angiograph), a sequence of anterior segment and fundus images was taken considering stable head position in 19 pairs of photographs of eyes with implanted tIOLs. The angle between reference fundus axis and tIOL axis was measured at both time stages (mean: after 3 months). The difference of the angle between bifocal-image samples was defined as the real tIOL rotation angle. 3. Ten pairs of anterior segment photographs of eyes with a tIOL were investigated using the Axenfeld loop analysis. In each photograph, the angle between the axis connecting two Axenfeld loops and the tIOL axis was measured. The difference of two angles of two photographs was defined as the rotational tIOL angle.
1. The mean absolute eye's rotation angle was 2.3 +/- 1.7 degrees (range: 0 to 11.5 degrees) in all 550 eyes. Only 9.1 % of the eyes did not rotate. In 57.3 % of the eyes a rotation of less than 3 degrees and in 33.6 % of more than or equal to 3 degrees was detected. The eye's cyclorotation correlated (p < 0.04) with an age older than 39 years and higher astigmatism (> 1.5 D). Because of the significant amount of spontaneous globe rotation we developed the following enhanced methods to minimize measurement errors of tIOL rotation: 2. Bifocal photography: comparing the 19 HRA anterior segment images, the amount of mean tIOL rotation was 5.4 +/- 4.8 degrees (range: 0 - 20.0 degrees). Using the bifocal photography, the mean tIOL rotation was 1.9 +/- 1.3 degrees (range: 0 - 5.0 degrees). The overestimated rotation of the tIOL (only anterior segment tIOL comparison) correlated with higher amounts of the eye's cyclorotation (r = 0.94; p = 0.01) and higher corneal astigmatism (r = 0.54; p = 0.05). 3. The simultaneous analysis of Axenfeld loops revealed significantly smaller amounts of tIOL rotation (2.3 +/- 2.5 degrees range: 0 - 7.0 degrees ) in 10 pairs of anterior segment photographs in contrast to the single analysis of tIOL axis (5.5 +/- 4.8 degrees range: 1 - 13.0 degrees p = 0.09). A reduction of up to 18.0 degrees tIOL rotation measurement failure was possible in single cases by applying the bifocal photography or simultaneous Axenfeld loop analysis.
Head inclination, head rotation, and incyclo- or excyclorotation of the eye may have a significant impact on the tIOL axis evaluation. Besides the bifocal photography the simultaneous Axenfeld loop analysis could be a promising alternative to the conventional axis evaluation of tIOLs.";;;"1.

This is a pilot study of a prospective (n = 12) and a retrospective (n = 14) series of patients who had uneventful phacoemulsification and IOL implantation of either hydrophobic acrylic (Acrysof; Alcon) or plate-haptic (PH) silicone (C11UB; Chiron, Bausch & Lomb) IOLs. The outcome of interest was the ability of OCT to clearly delineate the outline of the IOL optics and their appositional relationship to the posterior capsule.
OCT showed that hydrophobic acrylic IOLs had a better defined outline than PH silicone IOLs. It also showed close apposition between hydrophobic acrylic optics and the mid-peripheral part of the posterior capsule and the absence thereof with PH silicone IOLs.
Hydrophobic acrylic implants have better definition on the OCT scans than PH silicone and they develop close apposition to the posterior capsule.

This prospective randomized control study included 39 eyes of 38 patients. Twenty eyes were selected randomly for removal of LECs from the anterior capsule as part of routine cataract operation comprising phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. The other 19 eyes were used as controls in which the LECs were not removed. All surgeries were performed by 1 surgeon (A.T.). All patients had silicone IOL (Allergan SI-40) implantation. The capsulorhexis opening size was determined immediately after surgery and 2 weeks and 6 months after surgery. Data on treatment outcome of the cataract surgery were analyzed statistically.
Six months postoperatively, the size of the capsulorhexis had statistically significant increased in the study group that had LECs removed (mean increase 1.07 +/- 1.70 mm(2); paired Student t test P=.01), whereas the capsulorhexis size had statistically significant decreased in the control group (mean decrease -3.38 +/- 2.37 mm(2); paired Student t test, P<.0001).

Institutional Review Board of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles County General Hospital, Los Angeles, California, USA.
A pilot group of 22 eyes of 22 patients scheduled for cataract surgery were enrolled in a prospective trial. All patients had a standard preoperative workup with subsequent cataract extraction and IOL implantation according to conventional biometric measurements and IOL calculations. Intraoperative autorefractive retinoscopy was used to obtain aphakic autorefraction and to measure the aphakic spherical equivalent before lens implantation. A linear regression analysis was used to correlate the aphakic spherical equivalent to the final adjusted emmetropic IOL power to empirically derive a refractive formula for IOL calculation (optical refractive biometry method). A second validation series of 16 eyes was used in a head-to-head comparison between the optical refractive biometry and the conventional IOL formulas. A subset of 6 eyes from the validation series were post-refractive cases having subsequent cataract surgery.
Intraoperative retinoscopic autorefraction was successfully obtained in all 22 patients in the pilot group and all 16 patients in the validation group. The spherical equivalent of the aphakic autorefraction correlated linearly with the final adjusted emmetropic IOL power (P<.0001, with adjusted r(2)=.9985). The relationship was sustained over an axial length range of 21.43 to 25.25 mm and an IOL power range of 12.0 to 25.5 diopters (D). In a subsequent validation series of 10 standard and 6 post-laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) cataract cases, the optical refractive biometry method proved to be a better predictive model for IOL estimation than conventional formulas; 83% of the LASIK eyes and 100% of the normal eyes were within +/-1.0 D of the final IOL power when aphakic autorefraction was used, compared with 67% of LASIK eyes and 100% of the normal eyes, using the conventional methodology.
A new model for IOL power calculation was derived based on an optical refractive methodology that breaks away from the conventional art introduced by Fyodorov in the 1960s. A purely refractive algorithm is used to predict the power of the IOL at the time of surgery without the need for axial length and keratometry measurements. This method bypasses some limitations of conventional biometry and shows promise in the post-refractive cataract cases.";;;"Intraoperative retinoscopic autorefraction was successfully obtained in all 22 patients in the pilot group and all 16 patients in the validation group.

Eighty-two patients were randomized to have phacoemulsification under cryoanalgesia or topical anesthesia. Uncooperative patients and those with shallow anterior chamber and small pupils were excluded. In case of breakthrough pain during the surgery, a supplemental anesthesia protocol was established. Each patient was asked to grade the severity of pain on a 4-point scale (verbal description score; 0=none, 1=little, 2=some, or 3=much). Immediately after surgery, the general discomfort and pain were evaluated. Surgeon stress was evaluated during surgery. A comparison of the 2 groups was performed using a statistical analysis of variance.
Supplemental anesthesia was required in 1 patient in each group. A total of 95.23% of patients would repeat the same technique under cryoanalgesia versus 97.5% under topical anesthesia. Similar pain levels and surgical stress scores were noted in both groups.

Fifty-three patients with bilateral age-related cataract (106 eyes) were included in this randomized prospective bilateral patient- and examiner-masked clinical trial with intraindividual comparison. Each study patient had cataract surgery in both eyes and received a Sensar AR40 IOL (anterior and posterior round optic edges) in 1 eye and a Sensar OptiEdge AR40e IOL (round anterior and sharp posterior optic edge) in the other eye. Follow-up examinations were at 1 week, 1 and 6 months, and 1, 2, and 3 years. Digital retroillumination images were taken of each eye. The amount of PCO was assessed subjectively at the slitlamp and objectively using automated image-analysis software (AQUA) 1, 2, and 3 years after surgery.
The sharp-edged AR40e lens showed significantly less regeneratory and fibrotic PCO 1, 2, and 3 years after surgery.

Filatov Institute, Odessa, Ukraine.
Cataract surgery was performed in 66 children aged 3 to 15 years. They were randomized to surgery with or without anterior vitrectomy. All eyes were implanted with the single-piece AcrySof SA30AL IOL (Alcon). During the study, the patients who needed surgery for after-cataract had a second surgical procedure. Two years after surgery, the surgical method was evaluated using exact logistic regression. Also, the Evaluation of Posterior Capsule Opacification (EPCO) score was compared between the patients who had surgery for after-cataract and the patients who did not need this. The presence of posterior synechias and centration of the IOL were assessed.
Children in the younger age group (</=62 months at surgery) had surgery for after-cataract more often than children in the older age group (P<.01). Patients who did not receive an anterior vitrectomy had surgery for after-cataract more often (P<.01).

One hundred six eyes of 53 patients with bilateral cataract and no other ocular comorbidity were prospectively randomized to receive a hydrophobic acrylic or hydrophilic acrylic single-piece IOL in the first eye to have surgery. The alternate IOL was implanted in the fellow eye 4 to 6 weeks later. All surgery was performed by a single surgeon. Postoperative follow-up was 1 day, 1 and 6 months, and 1 year. At each visit, the best corrected high- and low-contrast visual acuities were assessed and a high-intensity digital retroillumination photograph was taken. Posterior capsule opacification was assessed from the digital images by a single operator using a dedicated software program and calculated as the percentage area of opacified capsule.
One year postoperatively, the median percentage area of PCO was 50.3% in the hydrophilic IOL group and 4.9% in the hydrophobic IOL group (P<.001). The difference in PCO was not accounted for by loss of contact between the capsulorhexis and IOL surface. Further analysis showed that lens epithelial cells tended to invade the posterior capsule at the haptic-optic junction. This was more marked in the hydrophilic IOL group.

The aim of this study is to assess in vivo whether a more physiologic, stimulus-driven accommodation is comparable to pilocarpine-induced IOL movement.
Controlled patient- and examiner-masked clinical trial.
The study population included 38 eyes with accommodative IOL implants (1CU) and a control group of 28 eyes with conventional open-loop IOLs.
A high-precision biometry technique, partial coherence interferometry, was used to measure IOL position. Anterior chamber depth was measured during physiologic (near point) and pharmacological (pilocarpine 2%) stimulation. In a subgroup of 14 1CU eyes, IOL position was determined repeatedly within 90 minutes after pilocarpine administration. A different subgroup was investigated as to the effect of cyclopentolate on IOL position. Best-corrected distance visual acuity (VA), best-corrected near VA, and distance-corrected near VA (DCNVA) were assessed using logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution charts.
Anterior chamber depth change under pilocarpine and near-point-driven accommodation.
Near-point accommodation did not induce movement of either the accommodating 1CU or the control IOLs. Pilocarpine induced a 201+/-0.137-mm anterior movement of the 1CU IOL (P<0.001), compared with no movement within the control IOL groups (P>0.05). There was no significant (P>0.05) difference in DCNVA between the accommodative and open-loop IOLs. No correlation between near point- or pilocarpine-stimulated IOL movement and DCNVA was found. Concerning the time course of movement after pilocarpine administration, most of the 1CU IOLs showed some movement 30 minutes after application. Cyclopentolate-induced ciliary muscle relaxation caused a posterior IOL movement, as compared with the relaxed state, when focusing on a distant target.
Pilocarpine-induced ciliary muscle contraction seems to overestimate IOL movement relative to a monocular near-driven stimulus.

In this prospective randomized comparative trial, 80 patients scheduled for cataract surgery were selected based on preoperative counseling and randomized to have multifocal or monofocal IOL implantation. Fifty-three eyes of 35 patients received a multifocal IOL and 67 eyes of 40 patients, a monofocal IOL. The incidence of complications and visual outcome in the multifocal and monofocal IOL groups were compared. Quality of vision was measured by comparing the severity of visual symptoms (glare, halos, and cataract symptoms score), changes in functional impairment measured by a 7-item visual function test (VF-7), changes in global measures of vision (trouble and satisfaction with vision), and range of accommodation and contrast sensitivity.
Intraoperative and postoperative complications and adverse events were few and required no further surgical intervention. Both distance and near visual acuities were significantly better in the multifocal group than in the monofocal group; the difference was most prominent in distance corrected near acuity (P<.001). Thirty-five eyes (67.3%) in the multifocal group and 10 eyes (14.9%) in the monofocal group achieved a distance corrected near acuity of J6 (20/40) or better; 30 eyes (56.6%) and 19 eyes (28.4%), respectively, achieved a best corrected distance acuity of 20/20 or better. Glare symptoms decreased postoperatively in both groups but were slightly more common in the multifocal group. In contrast, halos were significantly more common at 1 month in the multifocal group (P<.001). Contrast sensitivity values were slightly lower with multifocal IOLs at almost all spatial frequencies, but the difference was not significant. The change in the quality of life postoperatively, measured with the VF-7, was significant and identical in both groups.

Eye Clinic, Department of Neurological and Visual Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.
Patients with no preexisting ocular conditions other than cataract who agreed to return for follow-up were considered. Twenty eyes of 14 patients with a best corrected visual acuity of 5/10 or worse and a refractive error (spherical equivalent) of +/-1.0 diopter (D) had implantation of a Crystalens AT-45 accommodating IOL. Six patients had bilateral implantation. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was performed postoperatively at 1 and 6 months. Before and during accommodation, the anterior chamber depth (ACD) was measured to assess the endothelium-IOL distance and measure the scleral-ciliary process angle to determine whether there was anterior rotation of the ciliary body. The uncorrected distance acuity, best corrected distance acuity, uncorrected near acuity, distance corrected near acuity, best corrected near acuity, and accommodative amplitude were determined. Analysis was done to determine whether there was a correlation between the accommodative amplitude and the percentage variation in the ACD and scleral-ciliary process angle.
All surgical procedures were uneventful. The mean uncorrected distance acuity at 1 month was 0.8 +/- 0.14 (SD) and remained stable at 6 months. Three of 20 eyes (15%) and 8 of 20 eyes (40%) had a Jaeger acuity of J1 and J3, respectively, without additional power correction. During accommodation, the mean reduction in ACD was 0.32 +/- 0.16 mm at 1 month and 0.33 +/- 0.25 mm at 6 months. The mean narrowing of the scleral-ciliary process angle was 4.32 +/- 1.87 degrees at 1 month and 4.43 +/- 1.85 degrees at 6 months. There was a correlation between accommodative amplitude and a decrease in the ACD (r=0.404) and a decrease in scleral-ciliary process angle (r=0.773).
Anterior displacement of the Crystalens IOL and corresponding anterior rotation of the ciliary body occurred during near vision.

This randomized double-blind study comprised 104 eyes of 52 patients with bilateral age-related cataract. All patients received round-edged intraocular lenses (IOLs); 26 received an SI-40 IOL (Advanced Medical Optics Inc.) in both eyes, and 26 received a Silens6 IOL (Domilens) in both eyes. Both IOLs consist of different silicone material and have different haptic angulation. The SI-40 IOL has 13.0 mm open-loop poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) haptics angulated by 10 degrees. The Silens6 IOL has 12.5 mm open-loop PMMA haptics with no angulation. In 1 eye, the anterior capsule was extensively polished. The anterior capsule was left unpolished in the contralateral eye, which acted as a control. Digital slitlamp photographs of the ACO and fibrotic PCO were taken with a standardized technique for 3 years postoperatively. The intensity of ACO was measured objectively (score 0% to 100%) using Adobe Photoshop software. Fibrotic PCO was graded subjectively (score 0 to 4).
The mean ACO was 17% in the polished eyes and 26% in the control eyes (P = .0001). The mean fibrotic PCO score was 0.5 and 1.0, respectively (P = .0007).

Primary outcomes consisted of near and distance visual acuity (VA). Secondary outcomes related to spectacle dependence, vision-related functioning, and patient satisfaction.

However, intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) with an anterior chamber lens (AC IOL) may be appropriate in rural Africa. A randomised controlled trial was carried out to compare these surgical strategies.
Participants over 50 years requiring bilateral cataract surgery were recruited from outreach clinics in rural north and east Uganda. One eye was randomly allocated to AC IOL or PC IOL, the other eye being allocated to the second strategy. The main outcome measure was WHO distance visual acuity (VA) category after a minimum of 1 year. Secondary outcomes were numbers and causes of complications and refractive corrections.
Of the 110 participants recruited, 98 (89%) were assessed at least 1 year after the operation (median follow up 17.5 months). Nine eyes randomised to PC IOL were converted to AC IOL; one eye randomised to AC IOL inadvertently received PC IOL. There was no difference in VA between 95 pairs of eyes for which data for both eyes were available (uncorrected VA, p = 0.26; corrected VA, p = 0.59). 80 (82%, 95% CI 73 to 89) and 82 (84%, 95% CI 75 to 90) eyes randomised to AC IOL and PC IOL respectively had corrected VA of 6/18 or better. 16 (16%, 95% CI 10 to 25) and eight (8%, 95% CI 4 to 15) eyes respectively had secondary procedures or other complications.

Patients presenting for cataract surgery who were randomly assigned to receive a Tecnis Z9000 IOL (Pfizer) or a Sensar OptiEdge AR40e IOL (AMO) in 1 eye were followed for 3 months postoperatively. The patient could elect to have the same type of IOL implanted in the fellow eye. The results of sine-wave grating contrast sensitivity testing under mesopic and photopic conditions were compared interindividually.
Monocular comparison was made between the 2 IOL groups, which comprised 15 patients each. The Tecnis IOL provided significantly better contrast sensitivity at 6 cycles per degree (cpd) under photopic conditions and at 1.5 and 3 cpd under mesopic conditions. Seven patients with a Tecnis IOL and 9 patients with an AR40e IOL had subsequent implantation in the fellow eye.

The cell loss between 1 year and 3 years in the absence of an increase in the coefficient of variation and/or a decrease in the percentage of hexagonal cells is most readily explained by prolonged corneal remodeling following the surgical procedure rather than ongoing cell loss.

All patients underwent phacoemulsification and IOL implantation. The 1CU accommodative lens was used in 20 eyes, and conventional IOLs (polymethyl methacrylate, hydrophilic or hydrophobic acrylate) were used in the control group. Patients were observed prospectively, and 6-month data were analyzed.
Accommodative ranges determined by 3 different methods (near point, defocusing, and retinoscopy). Secondary outcome measures were (1) increase of anterior chamber depth after topical application of 1% cyclopentolate eyedrops and (2) distance-corrected near visual acuity with Birkhäuser reading charts at 35 cm.

In study 1, a 3-piece silicone IOL with nonangulated modified C-loop haptics (MicroSil, Dr. Schmidt) was implanted in 78 eyes of 39 patients; patients were randomized to receive a round-edged optic IOL in 1 eye and a sharp-edged optic IOL in the other eye.

In this prospective comparative study, a phakic IOL was implanted in 217 highly myopic eyes (118 patients). Fifty-nine eyes received an Adatomed IOL, 21 eyes a Staar IOL, and 137 eyes an Artisan IOL. The mean preoperative spherical equivalent was -15.39 diopters (D) +/- 2.83 (SD), -16.00 +/- 5.05 D, and -16.17 +/- 2.75 D in the Adatomed, Staar, and Artisan groups, respectively. The mean follow-up was 32.4 months (range 19 to 46 months) in the Adatomed group, 18.3 months (range 11 to 21 months) in the Staar group, and 121.4 months (range 38.4 to 154.3 months) in the Artisan group. At the follow-up examinations, intraocular pressure (IOP), IOL pigment deposits, cataract formation, and visual acuity were evaluated.
The best corrected and uncorrected visual acuities improved in all eyes. No significant differences in visual acuity improvement were observed with the 3 materials, although the improvement was somewhat greater in eyes with the Artisan and Staar IOLs. The difference in mean IOP between preoperatively and the last follow-up examination was 1.5 mm Hg in the Staar group, 1.3 mm Hg in the Adatomed group, and 1.7 mm Hg in the Artisan group (P =.36, P =.26, and P =.32, respectively). The incidence of pigment deposits was similar in the Adatomed and Staar groups, with deposits in 32 eyes (54.23%) and 8 eyes (38.1%), respectively. Anterior cataract formation was higher in the Adatomed group (44.06%) than in the Staar group (9.52%); nuclear cataract developed in 2 Adatomed eyes (1.46%) only.
There was a higher incidence of anterior subcapsular cataract formation in the Adatomed group than in the Staar group.

Department of Ophthalmology, Bundesknappschaft's Hospital, Sulzbach, Germany.
In an intraindividual randomized study of 45 patients with bilateral cataract, an IOL with a modified anterior surface (Tecnis Z9000, Pharmacia) was compared with a biconvex lens with spherical surfaces (SI-40, Allergan). All patients had bilateral cataract surgery; in 1 eye the Z9000 IOL was implanted and in the other, the SI-40 IOL. After 1 and 3 months, the following investigations were performed: assessment of the anterior and posterior segments including IOL decentration and tilt, pupil size, high- and low-contrast visual acuities, photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivities, and wavefront aberration of the cornea and eye.
Thirty-seven patients were examined at all follow-up visits. Although the eyes with the Z9000 IOL had significantly better best corrected visual acuity after 3 months, the improved quality of vision was more apparent when assessing low-contrast visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. Wavefront measurements revealed no significant spherical aberration in eyes with a Z9000 IOL but significantly positive spherical aberration in eyes with an SI-40 IOL.
The clinical results confirm the theoretical preclinical calculations that the spherical aberration of the eye after cataract surgery can be eliminated by modifying the anterior surface of the IOL.

Department of Ophthalmology, University of Vienna, Medical School, Vienna, Austria.
This prospective randomized study comprised 50 eyes of 34 children aged between 2 and 16 years. Eyes of children between 2 and 5.9 years were consecutively randomized to Group 1a (primary posterior capsulotomy and anterior vitrectomy) or Group 1b (optic capture in addition). Eyes of children between 6 and 16 years were consecutively randomized to Group 2a (primary posterior capsulotomy without anterior vitrectomy), Group 2b (optic capture in addition), or Group 2c (in-the-bag IOL implantation without opening the posterior capsule). Main outcome parameters were the incidence and severity of PCO formation, early postoperative complications, pigmented cell deposits on the IOL surface, and cataract morphology.
The visual axis was clear at the last follow-up in all eyes in Groups 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b except in 1 eye in Group 1a. Sixty-percent of eyes in Group 2c had PCO. The incidence of early postoperative complications was significantly higher in eyes that developed PCO than in those that maintained a clear visual axis. There was no evidence that cataract morphology influenced PCO rates.
The AcrySof IOL was well tolerated in pediatric eyes. Optic capture was not necessary to ensure a clear visual axis. Primary posterior capsulotomy should be performed in preschool and uncooperative children and in eyes expected to have relatively high postoperative inflammation.

Seventy eyes underwent implantation of a TPIOL with an optical zone of 5.0 mm (Artisan, Ophtec, Groningen, The Netherlands). The dioptric power of the intraocular lens was calculated by considering refraction, keratometry, and anterior chamber depth. The follow-up was 6 months in all cases. Lenses were available in powers ranging from +12.0 D to -23.5 D (spherical equivalent) in 0.5-D increments, with additional cylinder from 1.0 D to 7.0 D, also in 0.5-D increments.
The main parameters assessed were best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), refraction, endothelial cell count (ECC), intraocular pressure, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, subjective complaints, and patient satisfaction.

Prior to and 1 month after PRK, the SRK/T formula was used to calculate IOL power in 88 eyes of 65 patients with a preoperative spherical equivalent refraction between -16.25 to +0.25 D (mean -5.39 +/- 3.19 D). IOL power was calculated by utilizing the spherical equivalent refraction as target both before and after PRK. Utilizing the postoperative corneal radius measurement (R2), an underestimation of the IOL power was found. For this reason, the mean postoperative corneal radius (R3) that gave the same IOL power found before surgery was calculated for each patient. The R3/R2 ratios were plotted against the axial eye length and a linear regression formula was used to calculate R2 correcting factors that gave the new corneal radius (R4). Patients were divided into classes according to axial eye length, and the mean R3/R2 ratios for each class were calculated and used to recalculate the new mean radius (R5).

Twenty-nine consecutive cases that have been operated on for silicone oil removal and cataract, with or without intraocular lens implantation, were included in a prospective study. Axial length measurement was done in silicone oil-filled eyes after changing the sound speed in vitreous cavity to 987 m/sec. The SRKT formula was used for intraocular lens calculation. The cataract was removed by phacoemulsification through corneal section or phacofragmentation through the standard vitrectomy sclerotomy. Intraocular lens implantation was done either on the peripheral anterior capsule (single piece, PMMA) or in the bag (acrylic foldable three pieces). The final refraction after at least 3 months' follow-up was measured. The difference between the predicted and the actual refraction was evaluated. A control group of 30 consecutive cases (20 nonmyopic and 10 highly myopic) of cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation in eyes not filled with silicone oil was included using the same evaluation methods.
The mean deviation of the final from the predicted refraction was 1.87 +/- 2.11 diopters (range, +3.25 to -9 diopters). A total of 72.4% had a deviation of +/-2 diopters. The mean deviation in high myopia was 3.04 +/- 2.68 diopters (12 cases) (range, +/-1.75 to -9 diopters), while in nonmyopic patients, the mean deviation was 1.04 +/- 1.04 diopters (17 cases) (range, +3.25 to -3.25 diopters). The difference between highly myopic and nonmyopic eyes was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Most high errors occurred in highly myopic eyes. There was no statistical difference between the types of silicone oil (1000 versus 5000) or the mode of cataract extraction (phacoemulsification versus pars plana phacofragmentation). In the control group, the mean deviation in high myopia was 1.48 +/- 1.02 diopters (10 cases) (range, +/-0.5 to -3.5 diopters), while in nonmyopic patients, the mean deviation was 0.65 +/- 0.75 diopters (20 cases) (range, +2.75 to -1.75 diopters).

Randomized controlled clinical trial.
Seventy eyes of 70 patients who were scheduled to undergo cataract surgery were randomly assigned to two groups using random number tables based on the type of IOL implanted: silicone or acrylic. Thirty-two patients in each group completed the follow-up.
All eyes underwent phacoemulsification surgery with implantation of either a silicone or acrylic IOL. All IOLs were accurately placed into the capsular bag.
Contact of the anterior and posterior lens capsule with the IOL optic surface was evaluated using the Scheimpflug videophotography system at 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 21, and 28 days after surgery. The postoperative day at which each capsule was completely apposed to the IOL optic was determined. In addition, anterior chamber depth was also measured.
The anterior capsule was in contact with the IOL optic on the same day or earlier than the posterior capsule in all patients. Complete apposition of the IOL was observed significantly earlier with silicone IOLs than with acrylic IOLs with both the anterior capsule (6.2 versus 3.6 postoperative days; P < 0.0001) and the posterior capsule (11.1 versus 7.4 postoperative days; P = 0.0339).

Department of Ophthalmology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.
This prospective nonrandomized comparative trial comprised 143 eyes recruited consecutively. Of these, 49 eyes had PEX, 43 had uveitis, and 51 served as controls. A standardized surgical protocol was used. Cell reaction, anterior (ACO) and posterior (PCO) capsule opacification, and flare were evaluated 1 year after cataract surgery.
Regarding uveal biocompatibility, the number of foreign-body giant cells (FBGCs) increased in proportion to associated ocular pathologies in both IOL groups. The difference between the Hydroview control and Hydroview uveitis groups was statistically significant. The number of FBGCs was greater on AcrySof IOLs than on Hydroview IOLs in all 3 groups. The difference in FBGCs between the 2 IOL types was statistically significant in the control and PEX groups. Regarding capsular biocompatibility, lens epithelial cell (LEC) outgrowth was inversely correlated with intraocular inflammation. Outgrowth was statistically significantly higher with Hydroview IOLs, occurring in 85% in the control group, 45% in the PEX group, and 28% in the uveitis group (P <.0001). With AcrySof lenses, the percentages were 0%, 8%, and 4%, respectively. The PEX and uveitis groups were more likely to develop ACO than the control group (P <.012). There was no statistically significant difference in ACO between the 2 IOL types in the 3 patient groups.

Flare was statistically significantly higher in the uveitis group than in the PEX and control groups with both IOL types (P <.012). There was no statistically significant difference in flare between the 2 IOL types.
Uveal and capsular biocompatibility depends on the intensity of ocular inflammation. The greater the inflammation, the less the biocompatibility of hydrophilic and hydrophobic acrylic materials.

A private practice in Marshalltown, Iowa, USA.
In a review of 2630 consecutive cases operated on from January 2000 through July 2001, ease of IOL insertion and integrity of the haptic architecture were evaluated in a prospective fashion at implantation. Subgroups of cases were studied prospectively to evaluate 3 factors: same-day incision competence after implantation (postoperative intraoperative pressure [IOP], 107 cases); 2- to 5-week A-constant validation (200 cases); 1-day, 2-week, and 1- and 5-month descriptions of optic centration with respect to pupil and capsule anatomy (79 cases); and a 1-day versus 9-month photographic comparison of IOL centration (70 cases). A retrospective evaluation of the population's diagnostic codes tabulated complications including increased postoperative iritis, cystoid macular edema, neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser intervention for posterior capsule opacification, and pseudophakic dysphotopsia. A retrospective review of a subgroup of 140 consecutive cases was done to categorize postoperative optic clarity.
Overall, the IOLs were easy to implant with no haptic or optic damage using a forceps or the Monarch injector. Subgroup studies confirmed good performance in the following parameters: There were no cases of incision incompetence evidenced by an abnormally low postoperative IOP. The lowest postoperative IOP was 6 mm Hg, with the overall mean IOP increasing to 29 mm Hg from the 17 mm Hg measured a mean of 102 minutes after surgery. The manufacturer's published A-constant was almost identical to that obtained in review (118.4 versus 118.38 for the SA30AL and 118.35 for the SA60AT). In verbal descriptions, IOL optic centration was assessed to be within 0.4 mm of perfect in 75 (95%) of 79 cases. Slitlamp photographs showed that 52 (98%) of 53 IOLs were in the same position 9 months after surgery as on the day of surgery. One IOL optic appeared to rotate 14 degrees. There were no cases of decentration greater than 1.0 mm in either optic centration subgroup. Given a normal postoperative topical steroid regimen, there were no cases of substantially increased or prolonged iritis. There were 17 cases (0.65%) of macular edema. An Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy was performed in 0.64% (13/2044) in the SA30AL group over a mean of 9 months (range 2 to 23 months) and in 0.34% (2/586) in the SA60AL group over a mean of 5.5 months (range 5 to 6 months). Pseudophakic dysphotopsia was diagnosed in 26 eyes of 18 patients (1% of 2630 cases), with 1 patient requiring an IOL exchange. Optic glistenings were observed in 11 (11%) of 100 SA30AL cases at a mean follow-up of 8 months. No glistenings in 40 cases were seen in the SA60AT group at a mean follow-up of 3 months.
The single-piece acrylic lenses performed well in all regards.

Eye Department, Schlosspark-Klinik, Charité University Berlin, Berlin, Germany.
In 5 hyperopic and 7 myopic eyes with varying astigmatic measurements, a refractive correction was achieved by implanting phakic PC IOLs (Staar Surgical Co.) and performing limbal incisions of different lengths. The incisions were placed approximately 1.0 mm from the limbus with a mean depth of 600 microm and a length of 6.0 mm +/- 0.9 (SD). The phakic PC IOLs were implanted after the limbal incisions were placed.
In the 5 hyperopic eyes, the astigmatism decreased from 2.7 diopters (D) preoperatively to 0.5 D at a mean of 7.5 +/- 1.7 months without alteration of the axis of highest bowing. In the 7 myopic eyes, it decreased from 2.2 D preoperatively to 0.7 D at 7.2 +/- 2.6 months. In 3 hyperopic eyes and 1 myopic eye, the limbal incisions were repeated.
The observed mean postoperative spherical equivalent was close to emmetropia. Repeat incisions were necessary in eyes exhibiting astigmatism greater than 2.5 D. The advantage of limbal incisions in combination with phakic PC IOL implantation is demonstrated not only by the astigmatic reduction but also by the axis stability.

Cataract surgery was performed using topical anesthesia and phaco-chop, phaco-flip, or divide-and-conquer phacoemulsification. A Staar AA4203TF or AA4203TL IOL with a 2.00 diopter (D) or 3.50 D toric power was implanted using a lens injector.

The mean follow-up was 23 weeks +/- 17 (SD).
The IOLs performed in a predicable fashion. The mean astigmatism correction with IOLs within 15 degrees of the intended axis was 1.62 D with the 2.00 D IOL and 2.86 D with the 3.50 D IOL. Eleven patients had IOLs that were rotated more than 15 degrees away from the intended axes; in 3, the astigmatism was worse than preoperatively.

Department of Ophthalmology, Medical School, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.
One hundred eighty eyes were prospectively randomized to receive 1 of 6 IOLs: hydrophilic acrylic Hydroview (Bausch & Lomb) or MemoryLens (ORC); hydrophobic acrylic AcrySof MA60BM (Alcon) or AMO Sensar AR40 (Allergan); hydrophobic silicone CeeOn 920 or CeeOn 911A (Pharmacia). The patients had standardized cataract surgery, postoperative medication, and follow-up. One year after surgery, 155 eyes were assessed. The cellular reaction was evaluated by specular microscopy of the anterior IOL surface. Anterior and posterior capsule opacification (PCO) was assessed semiquantitatively by biomicroscopy. Flare was measured with a Kowa FC-1000 laser flare-cell meter.
Regarding uveal biocompatibility, the hydrophobic acrylic IOLs showed the highest incidence of late foreign-body cell reaction (AcrySof, 30%; AR40, 17%) followed by the hydrophilic acrylic (MemoryLens, 8%; Hydroview, 4%) and silicone (CeeOn 920, 4%; CeeOn 911A, 0%) (P =.0044). In all cases, the cellular reaction was low grade and clinically insignificant. Regarding capsular biocompatibility, some eyes developed lens epithelial cell (LEC) outgrowth on the anterior IOL surface. The highest incidence was in the hydrophilic acrylic group (Hydroview, 85%; MemoryLens, 27%) followed by the hydrophobic acrylic (AcrySof, 4%; AR40, 3%). No silicone IOL had LECs on the anterior surface. The difference among IOL groups was significant (P =.0001). Anterior capsule opacification was more predominant in the hydrophobic IOL groups. Posterior capsule opacification of the central 3.0 mm area was lowest in the groups with a sharp-edged optic (CeeOn 911A, AcrySof) followed by the round-edged silicone (CeeOn 920), hydrophobic acrylic (AR40), and hydrophilic acrylic IOLs (P =.0001). There was a significant difference in flare between the AR40 lens and the Hydroview, MemoryLens, CeeOn 911A, and CeeOn 920 (P <.004). There was no statistically significant difference in the postoperative cell count at 1 year. The power calculation showed that the sample size was sufficient.
The differences in cellular reaction, although clinically mild in normal eyes, indicate that there were more giant cells with hydrophobic acrylic IOLs and an increased tendency toward LEC outgrowth with hydrophilic lenses. The incidence of PCO was lowest in the hydrophobic IOL groups, especially in groups with a sharp-edged optic.

Forty eyes with senile cataract only were randomly assigned to Group A, which had curettage of the entire anterior capsule, or Group B, which had curettage of the nasal half of the anterior capsule. Rentsch capsule curettes (Geuder) were used, a straight one for the nasal half and a bent model for the temporal half. One surgeon performed all standardized procedures with a temporal clear corneal incision, phacoemulsification, and in-the-bag implantation of a hydrogel IOL. Two years after surgery, the anterior surface of the IOL was examined by specular microscopy in a double-blinded fashion, and LEC outgrowth was graded semiquantitatively. Anterior capsule opacification (ACO) was also graded semiquantitatively.
In Group A, grade 2 ACO was observed in 53% of patients and grade 1 ACO in 47%. Similar results were achieved in Group B (59% and 41%, respectively).

Forty patients with age-related cataract were randomly divided into two groups: 20 patients received the Progress 3 aspheric multifocal IOL, and 20 patients received a conventional monofocal IOL of similar design. Contrast sensitivity was measured with the Pelli-Robson letter-based chart. Depth of focus was determined by dialling a series of overcorrections over the patient's manifest refraction until the patient read 6/12 clearly. The depth of focus was defined as the range over which 6/12 or better acuity was achieved. Quality of vision was evaluated by patient questionnaire.
Mean contrast sensitivity was significantly lower in the patients with a multifocal IOL than in those with a monofocal IOL (1.38 vs. 1.56 log units) (p < 0.001). The mean depth of focus values for the two groups were 3.10 D and 1.65 D respectively (p < 0.001). The prevalence of subjective problems was similar in the two groups.
In our opinion, aspheric multifocal IOLs should be reserved for patients who are willing to trade increased depth of focus for reduced contrast sensitivity postoperatively.";;;Mean contrast sensitivity was significantly lower in the patients with a multifocal IOL than in those with a monofocal IOL (1.38 vs. 1.56 log units) (p < 0.001).

Thirty-seven patients with age-related cataract had bilateral small incision cataract surgery with a PCCC performed after capsular tension ring insertion. One eye was randomly assigned to receive a hydrogel IOL and the other eye, a silicone IOL. Standardized digital retroillumination photographs were taken 1 day, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery to evaluate changes in the dimensions of the anterior and posterior capsulorhexis opening area and the presence of anterior and posterior capsule opacification.

Three hundred eyes of 300 patients scheduled to have IOL implantation were initially randomized into 3 groups based on IOL type: PMMA, silicone, or acrylic. Of the 300 eyes, 269 completed the follow-up. The PCO density in these eyes was measured 1 week and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively using special computer software developed for the Scheimpflug videophotography system. Visual acuity and the incidence of neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy were also examined.
Three months postoperatively and later, the mean PCO value in the PMMA group increased significantly (P <.0001); the increase in the silicone and acrylic groups was not significant. The PCO value in the PMMA group was significantly greater than in the silicone or acrylic group (P <.0001). The PCO value in the acrylic group was slightly less than in the silicone group at 18 and 24 months, but the difference was marginal.

One hundred eyes scheduled for cataract surgery were prospectively randomized into 4 groups of 25 eyes each using random number tables. Group 1 received a Hydroview IOL (Bausch & Lomb), Group 2 an AcrySof IOL (Alcon), Group 3 a MemoryLens IOL (ORC), and Group 4 a CeeOn 920 IOL (Pharmacia). Patients were examined 1, 3, 7, 30, 90, and 180 days postoperatively. Postoperative biomicroscopic examinations were done with a slitlamp, and a specular microscope was used to document the presence of cell deposits and identify areas with the highest density of cells.
The local tissue response revealed 2 patterns: a nonspecific foreign-body reaction to the IOL (small round, fibroblast-like, epithelioid, and giant cells) and a lens epithelial cell (LEC) reaction. The highest incidence of LECs was in the Hydroview group, in which LECs were present on 81.8% of lenses 180 days postoperatively. During the first postoperative days, small round and fibroblast-like cells were found on all IOLs. From 7 days on, the incidence and density of these cells were less severe in the Hydroview and CeeOn 920 groups. After several weeks, epithelioid cells and foreign-body giant cells were seen on some IOLs. These cells appeared more often on AcrySof, MemoryLens, and CeeOn IOLs.

One day postoperatively, no IOL in either group was decentered more than 1.0 mm. After 5 months, 33% of the C10 and 42% of the C11 IOLs were decentered between 0.5 and 1.0 mm, and 11% of the C10 and 8% of the C11 IOLs were decentered more than 1.0 mm (maximum 1.23 mm and 1.41 mm, respectively). Up to the first postoperative day, 20% of the C10 and 22% of the C11 lenses were rotated more than 15 degrees. At 5 months, an additional 15% of the C10 and 19% of the C11 lenses were rotated. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed no tissue or capsule adhesion in the holes in most cases (85% C10 group; 71% C11 group). No difference was statistically significant.
Larger positioning holes did not prevent IOL decentration or rotation; thus, this IOL design appears unsuitable for correcting astigmatism.

816;11133704;Long term clinical outcome of a randomised controlled trial of anterior chamber lenses after high volume intracapsular cataract surgery.;[];The British journal of ophthalmology;"Age related cataract remains the major cause of blindness throughout the world. In many countries, the majority of cataract surgery continues to be done by the intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) method. The results of a large randomised controlled trial of multiflex open loop anterior chamber intraocular lenses (ACIOL) were reported from a busy eye hospital in Nepal.
There was a randomised controlled trial of 2000 people with bilateral cataract reducing vision to less than 6/36. Interventions were ICCE with an ACIOL compared with ICCE with aphakic spectacles (+11 dioptres). Participants were followed at discharge, 6 weeks, 1 year, and 1 1/2-5 years after surgery. Visual acuity and clinical outcome were measured. A poor outcome was defined as vision <6/60.
Visual outcome was comparable in the two groups. More of the control group experienced functional blindness due to loss of aphakic spectacles at 1 year. The majority of cases of poor outcome occurred in the first year after surgery. There was no indication of any lens related problems after 1 year.
Multiflex open loop anterior chamber lenses are safe for up to 1 year of follow up when used by experienced surgeons, and the available evidence of 2-5 years of follow up suggests that the complication rate is reasonably low. An ACIOL at the time of cataract surgery offers benefits over routine ICCE surgery with aphakic spectacle correction as it avoids the problem of replacing lost and broken spectacles.";Multiflex open loop anterior chamber lenses are safe for up to 1 year of follow up when used by experienced surgeons, and the available evidence of 2-5 years of follow up suggests that the complication rate is reasonably low.

The procedure is nearly always accompanied by implantation of a monofocal intraocular lens (IOL), which corrects the patient's distance vision. The authors' objective was to measure visual function and quality-of-life outcomes associated with bilateral implantation of a multifocal IOL, which corrects distance and near vision, and to compare the outcomes with those of the standard therapy.
A prospective, randomized, double-masked, clinical trial was conducted at eight sites in the United States, seven sites in Germany, and one site in Austria.
Participants included 245 cataract patients, 127 of whom received the multifocal IOL bilaterally and 118 of whom received a monofocal IOL of nearly identical construction bilaterally.
Clinical data included visual acuity (VA), complications, and adverse events. Quality-of-life data were collected using a previously validated survey instrument at baseline, after first eye surgery, and after second eye surgery.

In a prospective study, three girls 9, 14, and 18 years old with high anisometropia and deep amblyopia were included in this study. The phakic posterior chamber intraocular lens (ICL; STAAR Surgical AG, Nidau, Switzerland) was used to correct the anisometropia. This intraocular lens was inserted in the anterior chamber through a 3.0-mm temporal clear cornea incision and manipulated into the posterior chamber using an iris manipulator. A peripheral iridectomy was performed using the Ocutome Probe (Storz; Premiere, St. Louis, Missouri). Local therapy with corticosteroids and antibiotics were prescribed for 2 weeks, and patients were followed regularly for a period of 6 to 9 months.

We performed a randomised, prospective study to compare the influence of the intra-ocular lens (IOL) material of two different IOLs on the postoperative inflammation of the anterior chamber.
28 eyes of 27 patients with PEX and cataract and 29 eyes of 29 control patients were included in this study. The IOLs used were the hydrophilic, acrylic lens: Bausch&Lomb-Hydroview and the hydrophobic, acrylic Alcon Acrysof MA60 lens. The patients were examined preoperatively as well as on day 1, 3, 7 and 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery using the Laser flare-cell meter (LFCM) KOWA FC 1000.
The preoperative flare and cell values were significantly higher in PEX eyes as compared to the control group. The values decreased after about 1 month to reach values comparable to those in the control group. Over the six months period there was no significant difference between the values of both lenses in the PEX group except on the first postoperative day where the flare and cell values were higher in the Acrysof-lens group. When comparing both groups with the Hydroview-lens there was also no significant difference, except on day 7, between the PEX group and the control group up to 6 months after surgery.

This prospective study comprised 40 eyes of 28 children, whose mean age was 26.08 months (range 4 to 55 months). Primary posterior continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis, anterior vitrectomy, and IOL implantation were performed in all eyes. Eyes were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups of 20 each: in 1 group, optic capture would be used and in the other, the noncapture technique. Permanent optic capture was achieved in 14 eyes, and 26 eyes had no optic capture. Mean follow-up was 16.53 months (range 5 to 24 months). A Student t test and chi-square test were used for statistical analyses.
All eyes in both groups maintained a clear visual axis. One eye in the optic-capture group developed a membrane in front of the IOL that required a secondary procedure.

A standardized surgical protocol was followed by a single surgeon using phacoemulsification with capsulorhexis; any patients with surgical complications were excluded, and all patients received standardized medication and follow-up. Patients were examined at days 1 and 7, months 1, 3, and 6, and years 1 and 2 after surgery. At each assessment, best-corrected logMAR visual acuity and Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity were measured.

There were no significant differences in visual acuity (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.61) or contrast sensitivity (ANOVA, p = 0.33) between the three groups. The mean residual refractive error of the foldable IOL group was hypermetropic in comparison with the rigid IOL group but not significant at the 99% level of probability (Mann-Whitney U, p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in astigmatism between the groups.
Implanting a foldable acrylic IOL gave no post-operative benefit in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity to pseudophakes over a less expensive rigid PMMA IOL, within this post-operative period. This study did not provide a comparison between the two lenses regarding post-operative complications, in particular the important long-term complication of posterior capsular opacification (PCO). Until and if any particular advantage of a given IOL in reduced incidence of PCO is confirmed, it appears more economical to implant the conventional rigid PMMA IOL using small-incision surgery.";;;All pseudophakes had corrected visual acuity of 6/9 or better.

A small ophthalmology group practice.
One hundred forty patients were randomized, 70 per group, in a prospective, partially masked study of cataract surgery using Healon GV or Viscoat. One ophthalmologist performed all surgery. Primary outcome variables were the 2 week postoperative changes in corneal thickness, endothelial cell density, mean endothelial cell size, and endothelial cell hexagonality. Several secondary variables were measured, and an analysis of the statistical power of the study was performed.
There were no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of age (P = .856), cataract density (P = .117), preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (P = .892), postoperative BCVA (P = .969), amount of viscoelastic material used during surgery (P = .444), amount of irrigating solution used (P = .125), or phacoemulsification time (P = .088).

The baseline position of the IOL was determined from a video frame acquired at the conclusion of surgery. Postoperative IOL position was documented using digital retroillumination images at 2 weeks and 6 months after surgery. Capsular fusion patterns were recorded using slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Correlation of IOL rotation with axial length, capsular contraction, and fusion was attempted.
Early IOL rotation, occurring between surgery and 2 weeks after surgery, was graded as mild (<10 degrees), moderate (10 degrees < to <30 degrees), or severe (>30 degrees) by a semiobjective online comparison of the images. Late IOL rotation, occurring between 2 weeks and 6 months, was measured more precisely using software developed specifically for the study.
Twenty-three patients were allocated the loop haptic and 25 the plate haptic IOL. The groups were comparable for demographic variables and numbers of patients excluded from analysis (P > 0.05). Five (24%) of 21 of plate haptic IOLs underwent severe early rotation compared to 2 (9%) of 22 loop haptics (P = 0.36).

This prospective study was a test-operator-masked, parallel-group comparison of the driving performance of 33 bilateral multifocal IOL patients and 33 bilateral monofocal IOL patients from the U.S. Array Multifocal study. Driving performance was evaluated under 3 poor visibility conditions (clear weather at night, clear weather at night in the presence of a glare source, and fog). Measures of performance included recognition rates and distances for signs, as well as detection rates, distances, and avoidance behaviors for hazards. Contrast acuity and sensitivity were also measured to evaluate possible correlations with driving performance.
No statistically significant differences between the IOL groups were found in 26 of 30 comparisons (86.7%).

After the introduction of phako ultrasound in cataract surgery, Eichenbaum et al. examined the use of a laser system to improve cataract surgery. A phase I clinical trial was started in the USA in 1996 and a phase II clinical trial is currently ongoing. The Laser technique was performed as follows. A clear corneal incision measuring 2.8 mm, capsulorrhexis, hydrodissection and hydrodelineation of the nucleus and the epinucleus were performed first. A chopping instrument was then introduced by a second port to facilitate the laser procedure. Finally, the incision was enlarged to introduce the foldable IOL in the bag without suture. Eight eyes of six patients with a soft cataract were operated by Nd:YAG Laser, and followed for 6 to 10 months. No particular difficulty was observed concerning the technical procedure in comparison with the phako ultrasonic procedure. Photon laser may be an alternative treatment for softer cataracts with the following advantages: the vulnerability of the posterior capsule to the sharp needle of the phako ultrasonic instrument is eliminated using Photon Laser. There is no propensity for incisional burns nor ultrasonic vibration. However, additional progress is required for its application in hard cataract cases.;;;;;;1999-04-30;[{'lastname': 'Tunc', 'firstname': 'Z', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Metropolitan Florence Nightingale Hospital, Gayrettepe, Istanbul, Turquie.'}]

A total of 31 eyes of 21 females and 10 males with a mean age at the time of surgery of 32.3 +/- 6.6 years (range, 24.4-49.5 years).
Subjective refractometry, standard keratometry, TMS-1 corneal topography analysis, and pachymetry were performed before and 15.8 +/- 10.4 months after PRK for myopia (n = 24, -1 .5 to -8.0 diopters [D], mean -5.4 +/- 1.9 D) or myopic astigmatism (n = 7, sphere -2.0 to -7.5 D, mean -4.4 +/- 1.9 D; cylinder -1.0 to -3.0 D, mean -1.9 +/- 0.7 D). The IOLP calculations were done using two different formulas (SRK/T and HAIGIS).
Keratometric power (K) and topographic simulated keratometric power (TOPO) as measured (Kmeas, TOPOmeas) and as calculated according to the change of power of the anterior corneal surface or according to the spherical equivalent change after PRK (Kcalc, TOPOcalc), IOLP for emmetropia, and postoperative ametropia for calculated corneal powers were assessed in a model.
After PRK, mean Kmeas and TOPOmeas were significantly greater (0.4-1.4 D, maximum 3.3 D) than mean KRcalc and TOPOcalc (P < 0.0001). On average, the relative flattening of the cornea after PRK was underestimated by 14% to 30% (maximum, 83%) depending on the method of calculation. The mean theoretical IOLP after PRK ranged from + 17.4 D (SRK/T, TOPOmeas) to +20.9 D (HAIGIS, Kcalc) depending on the calculation method for corneal power and IOLP calculation formula used. For both formulas, IOLP values using keratometric readings were significantly higher (>1 D) than IOLP values using topographic readings (P < 0.0001). The theoretically induced mean refractive error after cataract surgery ranged from +0.4 to +1.4 (maximum, +3.1) D. Corneal power overestimation and IOLP underestimation correlated significantly with the spherical equivalent change after PRK (P = 0.001) and the intended ablation depth during PRK (P = 0.004).
To avoid underestimation of IOLP and hyperopia after cataract surgery following PRK, measured corneal power values must be corrected. The calculation method using spherical equivalent change of refraction at the corneal plane seems to be the most appropriate method. In comparison with this method, direct power measurements underestimate corneal flattening after PRK by 24% on average. Use of conventional topography analysis seems to increase the risk of error. However, because this study is retrospective and theoretical, there is still a need for a large prospective investigation to validate the authors' findings.";;;After PRK, mean Kmeas and TOPOmeas were significantly greater (0.4-1.4 D, maximum 3.3 D) than mean KRcalc and TOPOcalc (P < 0.0001).

This prospective study comprised 30 eyes of 30 patients operated on consecutively for cataract by phacoemulsification and in-the-bag implantation of a BioComFold (15 patients) or a foldable control (15 patients) IOL. The BioComFold IOL has a peripheral bulging ring that pushes the optic forward during the effort to accommodate, creating a zoom effect. Pseudoaccommodation amplitude was evaluated using the blurring of controlled vision by adding spheres, with the best correction for distance vision in place. Pupil diameter was measured with a Goldmann campimeter under constant illumination. Anterior chamber depth was determined by A-scan (Paxial, Biophysic Medical) 30 minutes after cyclopentolate 1% was instilled and again 30 minutes after pilocarpine 2% was instilled.
The difference in pseudoaccommodation amplitude and pupil diameter between the 2 groups was not statistically significant (P = .6737 and P = .4014, respectively).

Vaasa Central Hospital, Vaasa, Finland.
Phacoemulsification with primary implantation of a posterior chamber IOL was performed in 50 patients. All eyes were implanted with a CeeOn IOL (model 920, Pharmacia & Upjohn) with a silicone optic and poly(methyl methacrylate) haptics. The ease of folding, implanting, and unfolding the IOL in the bag were recorded. Visual acuity, postoperative complications, optic decentration, and optic tilt were measured at 5 postoperative visits. The IOLs were evaluated for haze and discoloration and the IOL surface, for inflammatory or pigment deposits. Follow-up was 12 months.
In 44 of 50 cases, folding the IOL was easy, and in 46 of 50, unfolding the IOL was controlled. The mean follow-up was 11.45 months +/- 0.52 (SD). No postoperative complications occurred, and 96% of patients achieved a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0.5 or better and 56%, a BCVA of 1.0 or better. The IOL decentration was less than 0.25 mm in 89% of cases, and there was no optic tilt. The neodymium:YAG laser capsulotomy rate was 11%.

The ring is an open, band-shaped, circular polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) ring measuring 11 mm in diameter with pre-tension (13 mm in diameter when the ring is open), 0.2 mm in thickness, and 0.7 mm in width. To retain sharp edges, the ring is not polished. The sharp edges should create a sharp, discontinuous capsular bend in the fornix, which induces contact inhibition of migrating lens epithelial cells after cataract surgery. This capsule-bending ring is inserted into the capsular fornix following phacoemulsification, prior to the implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL). In a multicenter trial, 100 patients were scheduled to undergo phacoemulsification and IOL implantation in both eyes within 1 month. The procedure was performed with the ring in 1 eye and without the ring in the other eye of each patient.
The anterior capsule was prevented from coming into contact with the IOL, and ACO was significantly reduced in the eyes with the ring, rendering the capsular opening larger 3 months after surgery. PCO was obviously reduced on slit-lamp examination in the follow-up period up to 6 months, but needs to be evaluated during a longer period.

In addition, the impact of use of a double (""piggyback"") IOL on refractive outcome was evaluated.
Prospective, nonrandomized comparative clinical trial.
A total of 136 consecutive hyperopic primary cataract-IOL cases operated on at in an outpatient eye surgery center were evaluated. The main inclusion criterion was the requirement of at least 30 D of emmetropia power.
Implantation of a total implanted power calculated using a newly developed (Holladay II) formula, which uses additional eye measurements (measured ACD, lens thickness, corneal diameter) in addition to the axial length and keratometry normally used, was performed. In the first series, IOL powers were chosen using the Lloyd-Gills formula with modifiers; in the second series, powers were chosen using the Holladay II formula option in the Holladay IOL Consultant software. Selection criteria for both series were the same (requiring at least 30 diopters [D] of power for emmetropia). Keratometry and axial length measurements (by immersion) were taken using the same instrumentation and methodology in both series. Predicted postoperative refraction based on the IOL implanted and the method of power calculation used were computed for each case in both groups and compared to the actual achieved refraction.
Main clinical outcome parameters evaluated were the postoperative spherical equivalent (compared with the predicted spherical equivalent) and the best-corrected vision. These outcome parameters were evaluated within each surgical series, in the total group of cases (regardless of power calculation method). Further stratification according to the use of single or double implants also was done.
In the group using an older formula system, mean preoperative spherical equivalent of 4.79 D was reduced to -0.67 D. Similarly, in the Holladay II group, the preoperative mean of 5.60 D was reduced to -0.58 D. However, there were fewer large deviations between predicted and achieved spherical equivalent in the Holladay II group as indicated by a smaller standard deviation of the absolute deviation (0.47 vs. 0.59), and the range of postoperative refractions was smaller with fewer large overcorrections or undercorrections. However, almost 90% of both groups were within a diopter of the predicted refraction. Visual results were comparable in the two groups.
Both IOL calculation systems showed good predictability in these extremely short eyes. The Holladay II formula was simpler because it is incorporated into a user-friendly software package (Holladay IOL Consultant) and required only the input of IOL constants and preoperative measurements with no ""fudge factor"" modifiers.

The majority of all cataract operations are still intracapsular extractions (ICCE). Aphakic correction using spectacles is problematical in developing countries. This study was undertaken to evaluate the safety of multiflex open loop anterior chamber intraocular lenses (AC IOLs).
A total of 2000 people attending Lahan Eye Hospital, South-east Nepal, with bilateral cataract were randomly allocated to receive in their first eye either ICCE with AC IOL (AC IOL group) or ICCE with aphakic correction (control group). All operations were performed by two ophthalmologists using a standardized technology and 4.5 x operating loupe magnification. Functional and best corrected vision was recorded. The primary outcome measure was poor vision after surgery, which was defined as a visual acuity of less than 6/60 at 1 year follow-up (WHO definition for severe visual impairment and blindness).
The median time needed to perform ICCE was 4.1 min and to perform ICCE with AC IOL 6 min. Of all study patients 91% were examined after 1 year. Five percent of the AC IOL group and 5.4% of the control group had a functional visual acuity of less than 6/60. Causes of reduced vision in the AC IOL group versus the control group were: correctable refractive error (22 vs 29), uveitis/secondary glaucoma (13 vs 2), endophthalmitis (4 vs 7), pre-existing eye diseases (4 vs 5), retinal detachment (0 vs 4), and corneal decompensation (0 vs 1). Of the control group, 24 patients were found to be functionally blind in the operated eye (vision < 3/60) because they did not wear their aphakic spectacles. Normal vision (WHO definition: > or = 6/18) was achieved best corrected in 89.9% of the AC IOL group and 93.2% of the control group. Analysis of additional long-term follow-ups (2-5 years post-operatively) has not yet been completed.

The difference was confirmed after 24 h (21.02+/-5.18 vs. 17.34+/-3.18 mm Hg, p < 0.01). Despite the medical treatment (acetazolamide 250 mg orally every 6 h), at the 24-hour control 2 eyes with plate haptic silicone lens showed IOP values higher than 30 mm Hg. Slitlamp examination showed in both eyes a shallowing of the anterior chamber together with the evidence of capsular bag hyperdistension and capsular block resulting from the occlusion of the circular anterior capsule opening by the plate haptic IOL. Residual Healon GV removal from the anterior chamber was performed. At 1-week control both eyes showed normalization of IOP. The use of a plate haptic silicone lens may be associated with a more consistent retention of Healon GV in the eye with trapping in the capsular bag.

In this prospective, randomized study, 60 patients with senile cataract scheduled for cataract surgery were divided into three groups of 20 each: Group 1 had phacoemulsification; Group 2, planned ECCE with continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis; and Group 3, ECCE with letter-box capsulotomy. Preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively, endothelial cell density, percentage of hexagonality, and the cell size variation coefficient were determined by contact specular microscopy; endothelial permeability was examined by anterior segment fluorophotometry and central corneal thickness, by ultrasonic pachymetry. Results were analyzed using the two-tailed Student's t-test and analysis of variance.
In all three groups, endothelial permeability and cell loss increased significantly from the preoperative values, but there were not significant differences among the postoperative values.

One eye in each patient received an HSM IOL and the fellow eye, a conventional unmodified PMMA IOL after phacoemulsification by the same surgeon. Anterior chamber flare was measured with the Kowa 500 laser flare meter 1 day before and 1 day, 1 and 6 weeks, and 3 months after surgery.
For most risk factors, mean flare was lower in the HSM group than in the PMMA group at most follow-ups. Significantly lower flare values (difference between postoperative and preoperative mean values) were seen in eyes with the HSM IOL at 6 weeks (P < .004) and 3 months (P < .003; Student's t-test). In the group with preoperative elevated flare values, the eyes with the HSM IOL had significantly better results 6 weeks (P < .0006) and 3 months (P < .01) postoperatively. The values in the HSM IOL eyes were also significantly higher in the diabetic with retinopathy group at 3 months (P < .003).

We developed and trained a neural network to predict IOL powers using a personalized Holladay program and clinical data from 200 consecutive cases of one surgeon's results with one IOL. Clinical data included preoperative axial length, both keratometry values, anterior chamber depth, and human lens thickness. The neural network was trained to produce the actual postoperative refractive error, and the Holladay surgeon factor was continuously refined using the same results. After the network was successfully trained against the clinical data, it was used to compute IOL power in a double-masked study. Ninety-five patients were randomized between the Holladay personalized calculation and the neural network computation.

Unfortunately, the ideal antiprostaglandin has yet to be introduced. This study represents the first prospective, case-controlled, randomized, masked, clinical trial comparing the efficacy of oral ketorolac tromethamine (KT) with the efficacy of topical flurbiprofen sodium (FS) and a placebo (normal saline) in maintaining intraoperative mydriasis without adrenaline in the irrigation solution.
Sixty-three patients, undergoing extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation, were randomly divided into three equal groups. Group 1 received 20 mg of oral KT 2 hours prior to surgery, group 2 received 0.03% FS topical solution at the recommended dosage, and group 3 received topical normal saline in a regimen identical to that of group 2. Identical mydriatics were used in both groups. The patients' pupils were measured at five stages of surgery.

We developed a procedure to calculate the average central power (ACP) of the cornea within the entrance pupil from videokeratography. Videokeratograph-derived keratometry-style readings (average K; K) and calculated ACPs, as well as the differences between the two values, were compared in four groups: normal corneas (n = 30), corneas with regular astigmatism (n = 30); post-radial keratotomy corneas (RK, n = 85), and post-excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy corneas (PRK, n = 63). Intraocular lens (IOL) powers calculated by using K or ACP in the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff formula were compared.
In the groups with normal corneas or regular astigmatism, none of the eyes showed a difference between K and ACP > 0.25 D.

Most live in rural areas of developing countries where surgical resources are scarce. There is no consensus on the most appropriate type of intraocular lens in situations where high-volume low-cost surgery is required. This study was undertaken to evaluate the safety of multiflex open-loop anterior-chamber lenses (ACIOLs).
2000 people attending Lahan Eye Hospital, southern Nepal, with bilateral cataracts reducing vision to 6/36 or less were randomly allocated to receive standard surgery--intracapsular extraction (ICCE) with aphakic correction--or ICCE with an ACIOL in their first operated eye. The primary outcome was a visual acuity of less than 6/60 in the operated eye at 1 year follow-up. Visual acuity was measured for 91% of the cohort at 1 year. The sample size was estimated to detect a doubling in poor visual outcome from an estimated rate of 4% in the standard surgery (control) group.
The median (range) time taken to do the surgery was 6.0 (3.0-17.2) min for the ACIOL group and 4.1 (2.4-10.3) min for the control group. 1 year after surgery, 5.0% of the ACIOL group and 5.4% of controls had functional vision less than 6/60 (OR 0.93 [0.60-1.43], p = 0.71). The causes of poor vision in the ACIOL and control groups were: correctable refractive error (22 and 29), uveitis/secondary glaucoma (13 and two), endophthalmitis (four and seven), pre-existing eye disease (four and five), retinal detachment (none and four), cystoid macular oedema (two and none), corneal ulcer (one and one), and corneal decompensation (none and one).

Efficacy variables included the signs of anterior-segment inflammation, primarily cells and flare in the anterior chamber, as observed by slit-lamp biomicroscopy; fluorescein leakage across the blood-aqueous barrier as measured by fluorophotometry; and the rating of efficacy by the investigator. No significant differences were seen between ketorolac and either glucocorticoid in cells and flare. No significant differences were found in other signs of inflammation, except conjunctival hyperemia and Descemet's folds at week 2. Ketorolac showed significantly greater efficacy than the glucocorticoids against blood-aqueous barrier breakdown at day 5 and week 2, as demonstrated by the difference in fluorescein concentration between the operated and nonoperated eyes.

Hachioji Medical Center and Tokyo Medical College Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.
In 107 eyes, washout (irrigation and aspiration [I/A]) of sodium hyaluronate was performed for randomly assigned durations of 5, 10, or 20 seconds following PEA and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. At the conclusion of washout, the flow from the I/A tip was reversed and a sample of the irrigating solution obtained from the anterior chamber. The residual sodium hyaluronate concentration was measured by sandwich assay. The kinematic viscosity of the sample was calculated from a regression equation derived from measured viscosities of standard hyaluronate solutions of various concentrations.
The preoperative mean IOP in the groups that received 5-, 10-, and 20-second washout was 11.9, 10.9, and 11.6 mm Hg, respectively. The mean IOP on the first postoperative day in the 5-second group was significantly higher (P = .001, Kruskal-Wallis test) than those in the 10- and 20-second groups (10.8 and 11.6 mm Hg, respectively).

This method was compared with retrobulbar injection.
150 patients (3 groups each consisting 50 eyes) underwent phaco with scleral incision. 1st group: oxybuprocaine sponge anesthesia. 2nd group: oxybuprocaine sponge anesthesia combined with mild systemic analgesia (tramadol p.o.). 3rd group: retrobulbar injection (prilocaine/etidocaine mixture).

Topically applied oxybuprocaine provides sufficient anesthesia during cataract surgery with scleral incision. A combination with mild systemic analgesia (tramadol) helps to minimize pain and discomfort. Retrobulbur injection yielded only in the postoperative period significantly better analgesia.

The MMC group had significantly greater reduction in mean intraocular pressure through the first 12 months of follow-up (7.05-7.65 mmHg versus 2.62-3.84 mmHg; P = 0.001-0.028). In addition, through the first 6 months of follow-up, the MMC group required significantly fewer medications (0.4-0.5 versus 1.1-1.2; P = 0.002-0.004). Requirements for additional glaucoma surgery were less in the MMC group (4/ 36) than in the placebo group (7/35) (P = 0.301).

978;8942891;Primary glaucoma triple procedure with or without adjunctive mitomycin. Prognostic factors for filtration failure.;[];Ophthalmology;"The prerequisite for selective use of adjunctive mitomycin C (MMC) in primary glaucoma triple procedure (PGTP) is a better understanding of the prognostic factors. Therefore, the authors carried out the current study on the outcome of PGTP with and without adjunctive MMC to determine the prognostic factors for filtration failure of PGTP.
The study patients consisted of 174 consecutive primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients undergoing PGTP. They were assigned randomly to either no adjunctive MMC (93 eyes of 93 patients) or adjunctive subconjunctival MMC (81 eyes of 81 patients) during the PGTP. After surgery, the patients were examined at regular intervals for visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP) control, medical therapy requirements, and complications. Filtration failure was determined according to two different criteria: (1) a less stringent set of criteria (criterion I) and (2) a more stringent set of criteria (criterion II).
There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with and without adjunctive MMC with respect to postoperative IOP, number of medications, and visual acuity outcome during mean follow-up (+/- standard deviation) of 25.1 +/- 5.5 months (P > 0.05 for each). However, there were prognostic factors for filtration failure in the control group but not in the MMC group. Black race, diabetes mellitus, preoperative IOP greater than or equal to 20 mmHg, and number of preoperative medications greater than two were found to be significant prognostic factors for filtration failure by criterion I. Black race, preoperative IOP greater than or equal to 20 mmHg and number of preoperative medications greater than 1 were significant prognostic factors for filtration failure by criterion II.
There was no statistically significant difference in the overall outcome of PGTP between control and MMC groups of nonselected patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. Black race, diabetes mellitus (by criterion I only), preoperative IOP greater than or equal to 20 mmHg, and number of preoperative medications greater than 2 (by criterion I) or greater than 1 (by criterion II) were found to be significant independent prognostic factors for filtration failure of PGTP without adjunctive MMC but no with adjunctive MMC.

Twenty-six nonglaucomatous patients and 13 glaucomatous patients scheduled for routine cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation were evaluated. In each patient, IOP was measured before cataract surgery and every 4 hours for 24 hours postoperatively. Thirteen of the nonglaucomatous patients were randomly treated with one drop of timolol maleate at the end of surgery (NG-T group). The other 13 nonglaucomatous patients (NG group) and all glaucoma patients (G group) were not treated.
In the NG group, mean preoperative IOP was 13.9 mm Hg. Following surgery, IOP rose steadily to 22.2 mm Hg at 12 hours; it returned to almost presurgical levels at 24 hours.

The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of lidocaine and bupivacaine with or without hyaluronidase for peribulbar blockade. Twenty-one patients scheduled for cataract surgery with lens implantation were included in this prospective randomized study. Peribulbar blocks were achieved with plain bupivacaine 0.5% (5.5 mL), lidocaine 2% (5.5 mL), and hyaluronidase (100 IU = 2 mL) (n = 10) ir sterile water (2 mL) (n = 11). Plasma bupivacaine and lidocaine concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography at regular intervals from the end of the local anesthetic injection until the 360th minute. Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to reach Cmax (Tmax) were obtained for all the patients except one who needed a supplementary injection and was excluded from the study. The time to onset and duration of the analgesia and akinesia were monitored at the times of sampling. Motor blockade was incomplete in two patients in each group without affecting surgery. The Tmax and absorption half-life (t1/2a) of lidocaine and bupivacaine were not different within each group (P > 0.05). The Tmax of lidocaine was shorter in the presence of hyaluronidase (17.1 +/- 2.6 min vs 32.7 +/- 6.0 min) as well as the Tmax of bupivacaine (16.8 +/- 3.0 min vs 26.5 +/- 4.4 min). The Cmax of lidocaine and bupivacaine were not modified by the addition of hyaluronidase. The clearance, terminal half-life, and volume of distribution were not different between groups. The absorption of lidocaine and bupivacaine from the peribulbar space are hastened by the addition of hyaluronidase. The Tmax of lidocaine is not different from that of bupivacaine within each group suggesting that the absorption of local anesthetics is minimally influenced by the liposolubility of the drugs. Moreover, hyaluronidase influences the absorption kinetics of both lidocaine and bupivacaine in the same manner.;;;;;10.1097/00000539-199605000-00032;1996-05-01;[{'lastname': 'Nathan', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, C.H.R.U.

In the present study, we compared the anti-inflammatory effects and aqueous humour concentrations of 3 topical NSAID (indomethacin, diclofenac, and flurbiprofen) during extracapsular cataract surgery.
We examined 90 patients (52-89 yrs of age) without pre-existing deficiencies of the blood-aqueous barrier. In 60 of these patients (series 1), and examination using the laser flare-cell meter was performed prior to and following extracapsular cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation. In 30 patients (series 2), aqueous humour was drawn intraoperatively, and the NSAID concentration was determined using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatment protocols with commercially available NSAID: protocol A: indomethacin 1% eyedrops (Chibro-Amuno -3); protocol B: diclofenac 0.1% eyedrops (Voltaren ophtha); protocol C: flurbiprofen 0.03% eyedrops (Ocuflur). 2 drops of either drug were administered as follows: day before surgery (4:00 p.m., late night), day of surgery (2, 1, and 1/2 hrs preop, end of operation, 4:00 p.m., late night), and days 1-3 postoperatively (5 times per day).
Under indomethacin therapy (protocol A), the flare [in photon counts/ms] increased from a preoperative value of 8.0 +/- 2.8 (means +/- SE) to 20.1 +/- 2.2 on day 1 postoperatively, and decreased to 16.9 +/- 2.5 on day 3. Under diclofenac therapy (protocol 2), the flare averaged 25.8 +/- 3.8 and 16.9 +/- 2.8 on postoperative days 1 and 3, respectively. Under flurbiprofen therapy (protocol C), the flare amounted to 31.4 +/- 6.6 and 26.2 +/- 3.4 on days 1 and 3, respectively. On day 1 postoperatively, there was a significant difference (p < 0.01) between all three treatment protocols. Postoperative fibrin exsudation was observed in 1 of 20 indomethacin- and 1 of 20 flurbiprofen-treated patients (5%), and in 4 of 20 diclofenac-treated patients (20%). The highest individual aqueous humour concentration of indomethacin was 430 micrograms/1, the lowest 30. The concentrations of flurbiprofen lay between 42 and 31, those of diclofenac between 80 and 30 micrograms/1. All patients treated with indomethacin had detectable aqueous humour concentrations, whereas 3 flurbiprofen- and 7 diclofenac-treated patients had no HPLC-detectable concentrations (detection limit: 30 micrograms/1).
After extracapsular cataract surgery, the anti-inflammatory potency of topical indomethacin 1% is superior to that of flurbiprofen 0.03% and diclofenac 0.1%, as demonstrated by the laser flare-cell meter. The rate of postoperative fibrin exsudation is lower under treatment with topical indomethacin or flurbiprofen compared to diclofenac. Using the commercially available substances (with different drug concentrations and vehicles), indomethacin exhibits a higher aqueous humour concentration than flurbiprofen, and diclofenac shows the lowest concentration.";;;Under indomethacin therapy (protocol A), the flare [in photon counts/ms] increased from a preoperative value of 8.0 +/- 2.8 (means +/- SE) to 20.1 +/- 2.2 on day 1 postoperatively, and decreased to 16.9 +/- 2.5 on day 3. Under diclofenac therapy (protocol 2), the flare averaged 25.8 +/- 3.8 and 16.9 +/- 2.8 on postoperative days 1 and 3, respectively. Under flurbiprofen therapy (protocol C), the flare amounted to 31.4 +/- 6.6 and 26.2 +/- 3.4 on days 1 and 3, respectively. On day 1 postoperatively, there was a significant difference (p < 0.01) between all three treatment protocols.

Military Hospital, Ulm, Germany.
In a prospective, randomized study, we evaluated IOP following cataract surgery using two different viscoelastic substances (Healon, Healon GV). The viscosity of Healon GV is 10 times higher than that of Healon because of higher concentration and molecular weight. Patients having identical phacoemulsification procedures (sutureless clear corneal tunnel incision with foldable silicone lens implantation) (N = 60) and identical viscoelastic removal were assigned to groups of 15 based on viscoelastic used and removal time (20 or 40 seconds). Intraocular pressure was measured preoperatively and at 6, 24, 36, and 48 hours and 1 month postoperatively.
The highest mean IOP elevations in both viscoelastic groups were obtained at 24 hours postoperatively (2.9 mm Hg +/- 4.3 [SD] with Healon and 3.3 +/- 6.3 mm Hg with Healon GV). There were no statistically significant differences between the two viscoelastics and the two removal times during the entire follow-up period (unpaired t-test), but standard deviations were higher in the Healon GV groups at 6 and 24 hours. Two patients in the Healon groups and three in the Healon GV groups required medical treatment for IOP within the first 24 postoperative hours; however, all five patients had an IOP lower than 22 mm Hg on the second postoperative day.
Based on postoperative IOP, both viscoelastics can be equally well removed from the anterior chamber. Incidence of high IOP using high-viscosity hyaluronic acid is minimized by the described removal technique.";;;"The highest mean IOP elevations in both viscoelastic groups were obtained at 24 hours postoperatively (2.9 mm Hg +/- 4.3 [SD] with Healon and 3.3 +/- 6.3 mm Hg with Healon GV).

Patients in the first group had only topical anesthesia, while patients in the control group had a peribulbar injection. None of the patients included had such conditions as deafness or dementia or felt overanxious. Both methods were accepted very well by the patients. There were no significant differences in the improvement of visual acuity and the opinion of the patients about pain during the operation. The surgeon's assessment revealed a few cases of increased voluntary eye movements in the topical anesthesia group, but this did not affect the complication rate significantly. There was one case of vitreous loss in each group and in the peribulbar group one case of zonular defect.

This is needed, if a supplement of gas is intended, its disappearance to be predicted (e.g. to 10% to permit travelling by plane) or the amount to be calculated to cover a break. Clinical estimation of gas in the pupil is limited by its size. Accuracy of pupil measurements will be tested and compared with experimental results obtained by estimating the level of gas meniscus at the retina.
Ten cadaver eyes (5 phakic, 4 aphakic, 1 pseudophakic) were fixed in a plastic mold, vitrectomized and injected with multiple randomized volumes of air. Two observers measured the level of meniscus in disc diameters above or below the superior margin of disc and then anteriorly in the pupil in millimeters from the superior limbus. Measurements were converted to milliliters through tables constructed on mathematical models of the phakic and aphakic eye.
Observations at the retina and in the pupil were equally accurate for intermediate gas volumes, for which the meniscus fell within the pupil (P = 0.372). Measurements at the retina proved less vulnerable to error induced by misalignment of the observer's eye. Above the pupil observations at the retina were still reliable for small bubbles up to 4 dd above the disc (error < 5% in the aphakic, < 10% in the phakic eye). Below the pupil observations at the retina yielded a result increasing less than the injected volume because of refraction at the anterior segment gas interface (error > 10% of the ocular volume).

Since it has been suggested that Neodymium: YAG (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy can provoke persistent glaucoma, we examined the hypothesis that Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy may lead to a permanent elevation of IOP. In a case-control study, we compared two groups of 75 normotensive patients, who were unilaterally pseudophakic after phacoemulsification (PE) + PCL. Patients in group 1 had undergone Nd:YAG capsulotomy at least 2 months prior to this study, while in group 2 the posterior capsule was intact. Both groups were selected at random. Prior to surgery, none of the patients had suffered from glaucoma. Goldmann applanation tonometry was performed in both eyes of each patient and from that the ratio of IOP(pseudophakic)/IOP(phakic) was calculated. The distribution of this ratio for the two groups was compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. There were 52 female and 23 male patients in group 1 versus 56 female and 19 male patients in group 2. Their mean ages were 75 + or -11 (group 1) and 75 + or - 9 years (group 2). The mean interval after PE + PCL was 48 + or - 29 months for patients with Nd:YAG capsulotomy and 16 + or - 17 months for patients with intact posterior capsule. Since the Nd:YAG capsulotomy, 28 + or - 23 months had elapsed on average. The median ratio of IOP (pseudophakic)/IOP(phakic) was higher in the Nd:YAG capsulotomy group than in the group of patients with an intact posterior capsule (1.00 vs. 0.80; p < 0.0001). There was almost no percentile, for which the distribution curve of group 1 intersected the curve of group 2. The median IOP in pseudophakic eyes was 14 mm Hg in group 1 and 12 mm Hg in group 2 (p<0.0001). These results are in accordance with the hypothesis that Nd:YAG capsulotomy will raise IOP permanently in most patients.

This is a retrospective case-control study of 40 consecutive patients who underwent combined temporal corneal phacoemulsification and superior trabeculectomy with low-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (cases), and 40 eyes matched with respect to age, race, preoperative medications, and preoperative IOP that had trabeculectomy alone with low dose 5-FU (controls). Survival analyses for IOP were performed for the cases and controls. We reviewed the charts of 40 consecutive patients who underwent combined temporal corneal phacoemulsification and superior trabeculectomy with low dose 5-FU to determine the effect on IOP, visual acuity, and requirement for glaucoma medications. For controls, we chose 40 eyes matched with respect to age, race, preoperative medications, and preoperative IOP who had trabeculectomy alone with low dose 5-FU. In both groups, trabeculectomy was performed with the same technique, was located superiorly, and employed a limbus-based conjunctival flap. In the combined surgery group, temporal corneal phacoemulsification immediately preceded trabeculectomy and employed a 3.5-mm incision and a one-piece silicone intraocular lens. All patients received 3 or 4 subconjunctival 5-FU injections of 5 mg each over the first 11 postoperative days. Patients were followed up for at least 1 year. Success of trabeculectomy was defined as an IOP less than 22 mmHg and 20% or more reduction from the preoperative level on 2 consecutive follow-up visits, regardless of the use of antiglaucoma medications.
The mean postoperative intraocular pressure was higher in the combined surgery group than in the control group at each follow-up interval (P < 0.05). The mean (+/- SD) IOP reduction was 6.8 (+/- 5.5) mmHg in the combined surgery group, and 10.3 (+/- 7.6) mmHg in the trabeculectomy group at 1 year. The reduction in the number of antiglaucoma medications was 1.6 (+/- 0.9) in the combined surgery group and 2.0 (+/- 1.0) in the control group at 1 year. In the combined surgery group, the mean visual acuity beyond the first postoperative month was significantly better than at baseline (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the cumulative success rate at 2 years was 62% in the combined surgery group and 86% in the trabeculectomy group. The time to failure was significantly shorter (P = 0.04) in the combined surgery group.
Combined surgery for cataract and glaucoma is associated with less long-term IOP reduction compared with trabeculectomy alone, despite identical trabeculectomy techniques in both groups. Nevertheless, combined surgery effectively lowers IOP and reduces the long-term requirement for antiglaucoma medications without additional complications. This technique is appropriate in selected patients with coexisting cataract and glaucoma.";;;The mean postoperative intraocular pressure was higher in the combined surgery group than in the control group at each follow-up interval (P < 0.05).

Mean protein concentration in the anterior chamber was also elevated in operated eyes. However, postoperative aqueous outflow did not differ significantly between the two groups. The substantial increase in aqueous outflow observed postoperatively and the increase in aqueous humor protein concentration were closely related to BAB disruption.

Randomisation was performed after screening for predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Demographics, visual acuities, intraocular pressures, and corneal endothelium cell data were recorded preoperatively and at 6 weeks. Details of surgical procedure, complications, and postoperative adverse reactions were recorded. Monitoring of the study was secured by a standardised image documentation procedure on all patients using the IMAGEnet digital imaging system. Analysis of corneal endothelial cell images was done using the CELL SOFT software analysis program.
343 patients were randomised to IOL and 319 to no IOL. Twelve IOL implantations (3.5%) were aborted because of complications. A complication was reported in 103 (15.6%) of the surgical procedures (IOL = 16.9%, no IOL = 14.1%, p = 0.37).

Best corrected near acuity reached 0.89 +/- 0.11 (20/22), requiring an additional near add of +1.0 to +2.0 diopters (D). We observed an age-dependent difference in the depth of focus. In younger patients (46 +/- 6 years), the pseudoaccommodation range was 6.25 D; acuity attained was > or = 0.4 (20/50). In older patients (71 +/- 7 years), visual acuity at the near focus was substantially reduced (two lines).

Contrast sensitivity and glare were dependent on the patient's age but did not change with the amount of postoperative astigmatism.

Moreover, the influence of ultrasound time and power on postoperative endothelial cell density was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Sixty-two patients (age 71 +/- 7.7 years) without corneal pathology were operated by phacoemulsification (Storz, Premiere) with a temporal, self-sealing, two-step clear-corneal incision followed by posterior chamber IOL implantation under viscoelastic (1% sodium hyal-uronate). Thirty-one one-piece plate-haptic foldable silicone IOLs (Chiron C10; Staar Surgical AA-4203) were implanted by an injector through a 3.5 mm incision (group A). The other 31 PMMA IOLs (Pharmacia 809P) were implanted through a 5 mm incision (group B). One surgeon performed all operations with the same technique (bimanual phacoemulsification in the capsular bag). Sutureless wound closure was performed in group A, while the wounds in patients of group B were closed with a single radial stitch. The central endothelial cell counts were recorded preoperatively, on days 2-5 and 6 months postoperatively using contact specular microscopy. RESULTS. The collective data revealed a cell loss of 7.9% (+/- 4.1 SD) on days 2-5 postoperatively and 6.7% (+/- 2.9) after 6 months. A direct linear relationship was found to exist between ultrasound time (UT) and ECL. In group A (7 patients) the ECL slightly increased from 3.5% in the first week postoperatively to 3.8% after 6 months, operated under UT < or = 1 min 30 sec. The ECL decreased from 8.2% to 6.4% after 6 months in group A (19 patients), operated under UT of 1 min 30 sec, and from 10.8% to 8.9% under UT of 2 min 31 sec-3 min 30 sec (5 patients).

Phenomenology and mechanism of action].;[];Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft;"The aim of this study was to analyze quantitatively the phenomenology and mechanisms of motor blockade induced by retrobulbar anesthesia (RETRO).
Prior to cataract surgery, 34 patients received RETRO using the intraconal technique of Atkinson. Four milliliters of mepivacaine 2% (Scandicain), prilocaine 2% (Xylonest) or lidocaine 2% (Xylocain) were injected in randomized order. Prior to injection, as well as 5, 30, 90, 120, 180, 300 and 420 min after injection, the following variables were determined: deviation of the eye from the primary position (Krimsky test), horizontal and vertical ocular motility (Kestenbaum limbustest), and rotatory ocular motility (presence of in- or excycloductions).
The directions in which the eye deviated after RETRO were abduction and depression. The maximum deviations amounted to 7-8 degrees abduction and 3-4.5 degrees depression and were observed 30 min after injection. Horizontal and vertical ocular motility was nearly completely and symmetrically reduced 30 min after RETRO. There were no significant differences between the three local anesthetics used.
The present findings may be interpreted as temporary palsy of N.III and N.VI during RETRO (symmetrical blockade of horizontal and vertical recti eye muscles) with unaffected function of N.IV and superior oblique muscle (maintained incycloduction ability; hypotropia and exotropia). An additional possible mechanism to account for the observed downward deviation is that the eye assumes its physiological divergent resting position during RETRO.";;;The directions in which the eye deviated after RETRO were abduction and depression.

The mean patient age is 62.9 years (range: 10 to 90 years). The mean follow-up time is 7.5 months (1 to 18 months). We used a long pulsed (300 microsec) laser emitting in the near infrared (2.1 microns). A conjunctival stab incision was made 12 mm away from the sclerostomy site to allow entry of a 22 G probe which delivers energy at a right angle to the long axis of the fiber. We used 100 mJ per pulse laser energy delivered at a rate of 5 impacts per second. The mean delivered energy to produce a functional sclerostomy was 16.1 J. All patients received subconjunctival injections of 5 Fluorouracil (mean number of injections: 7.4).

Statistically-significant rises in IOP with IAL and Healon were observed at 6 and 24 hours; no such rises were observed with Oculose (P < .05). Seven eyes in the IAL group and six in the Healon group had IOPs greater than 22 mm Hg at 6 hours (range: 22 to 38 mm Hg and 22 to 28 mm Hg, respectively). A significant increase in average corneal thickness was observed in all of the 60 patients at 6 hours (18.5%). The average thickness decreased to 6.8% by day 10, with no intergroup variations. There were significantly fewer anterior chamber cells at 6 hours in the Healon group. We conclude that all three viscoelastics are equally useful for routine ECCE with PC-IOL implantation. However, IAL and Healon do cause an early postoperative IOP increase, which, though transient, should be treated.";;;;;;1994-08-01;[{'lastname': 'Dada', 'firstname': 'V K', 'initials': 'VK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.'}, {'lastname': 'Sindhu', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sachdev', 'firstname': 'M S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': None}]

Prednisolone acetate 0.5% eye drops were the basic therapy in all three groups. As criteria served the difference between pre- and postoperative flare and cell concentration in the anterior chamber, measured using the laser flare cell meter, the clinical course, and the level of the inflammatory mediator 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha (prostacyclin) in the aqueous humor after intraoperative paracentesis, determined by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The level of prostacyclin was not influenced in any of the three groups. The numbers of cells decreased continuously, but without marked differences among the groups. On the basis of the concentration of protein measured in the aqueous humor and the clinical course, diclofenac 0.1% proved to be a more potent additive anti-inflammatory therapy than flurbiprofen 0.03% immediately after the surgical procedure (P = 0.039 at 1 day after operation), but the final results (4 weeks after operation) revealed no detectable difference. By application of placebo, an obvious higher concentration of protein was measured during all the observations (P = 0.0002).

However, previous studies from our clinic have shown no significant MVA difference between multi- and monofocal IOLs. In the present study (with the patients matched exactly for age), this topic was reevaluated.
We investigated three groups, each consisting of 28 persons, 51 to 60 years of age. Group I consisted of healthy phakic volunteers, group II of patients 3 months after cataract extraction and implantation of a monofocal posterior chamber IOL (Pharmacia 720A) and group III of patients 3 months after implantation of a diffractive multifocal posterior chamber IOL with biconvex optic configuration (3M 825X).

The Ocutrast, a modification of the Mesoptometer II, provides a field luminance of 1 cd/m2 and a contrast of 1:23 between test optotype and background; the intensity of illumination under glare conditions amounts to 0.35 lx at the level of the pupil.
The MVA without glare amounted to 0.50 +/- 0.12 (group I, healthy phakic eyes), 0.45 +/- 0.15 (group II, monofocal IOLs) and 0.32 +/- 0.11 (group III, multifocal IOLs).

The incisions were 5.5 mm and 6.5 mm, respectively. Follow-up visits including keratometry were scheduled 1 day, 5 days, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. The induced astigmatism was calculated using vector analysis. One day after operation the mean induced cylinder was 1.22 D in group I and 1.06 D in group II.

There was, however, transient, slight diffuse superficial corneal edema in 24% of group 1 and 4% of group 2, raising the question of inadequate oxygen transmission through collagen shields under closed lids. The results suggest that collagen shields used with the right solution have no significant adverse effect and may be a less invasive alternative to subconjunctival injection.;;;;;10.1177/112067219400400307;1994-07-01;[{'lastname': 'Menchini', 'firstname': 'U', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Udine, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Lanzetta', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ferrari', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Soldano', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vita', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]
1089;8008341;Continued endothelial cell loss ten years after lens implantation.;[];Ophthalmology;"To investigate the effects of cataract extraction and lens implantation on the central corneal endothelium 10 years after surgery.
The authors conducted a prospective study of 253 consecutive eyes that underwent cataract extraction with or without lens implantation by one surgeon from 1976 to 1982. Three types of lens implant were used during this period. The protocol included ophthalmic examinations and specular microscopy on all eyes preoperatively, and 2 months and 1, 3, 5, and 10 years postoperatively.
The 10-year analysis was conducted on 67 (26%) of the 253 total eyes. The remaining patients died (86 eyes [34%]), were unable to return 10 years later (93 eyes [37%]), or had secondary implants (5 eyes [2%]) or penetrating keratoplasty (2 eyes [1%]). There were no statistically significant differences among the median 10-year endothelial cell losses of 36% in 17 control cataract extractions without lens implantation (15 extracapsular and 2 intracapsular), 40% in 15 medallion iris suture implants, 32% in 28 transiridectomy clip implants, and 32% in 7 posterior chamber implants. The median exponential rate of chronic cell loss from 1 to 10 years after surgery was 2.5% per year, which did not differ significantly among the three implant groups or between the implants (2.4% per year) and controls (2.7% per year). The chronic cell loss rate was significantly higher (7.2% per year) in six eyes with cornea guttata, which was the only preoperative endothelial morphologic feature that was significantly associated with the chronic cell loss rate.
Ten years after cataract extraction, eyes continued to lose endothelial cells from the central cornea at a rate of 2.5% per year, 2.5 to 8.0 times the rate in healthy unoperated eyes. The rate was not affected significantly by the presence of the three types of lens implants that the authors used. Postoperative eyes with cornea guttata continued to lose cells at more than twice this rate.

Thirty-two patients undergoing cataract extraction received either 0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, or 0.3% ofloxacin topical drops. The patients were given two drops 90 minutes preoperatively and two drops 30 minutes preoperatively. At the time of surgery, 0.1 ml aqueous fluid was aspirated from the anterior chamber and immediately stored at -70 degrees C.
Concentrations of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin were determined using a broth dilution bioassay. Morganella morganii with a known minimal inhibitory concentration was used to assay ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin levels. Salmonella enteritidis with a known minimal inhibitory concentration was used to assay ofloxacin levels. Topically applied ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 0.072 microgram/ml (range, 0.02-0.153 microgram/ml). One sample was below the sensitivity of the bioassay. Topical norfloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 0.0570 microgram/ml (range, 0.046-0.10 microgram/ml). Seven samples did not reach the sensitivity of the bioassay. Topical ofloxacin achieved a mean level in the aqueous humor of 0.338 microgram/ml (range, 0.078-0.625 microgram/ml).

A laser flare cell photometry study].;[];Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft;"The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac (Voltaren) has recently become commercially available in form of 0.1% eyedrops (Voltaren ophtha). In the present study, we compared the anti-inflammatory effect of a topical combination therapy with diclofenac and prednisolone vs. indomethacin and prednisolone.
The FC-1000 laser flare-cell photometer (Kowa) was used to investigate 40 patients before and after cataract surgery with IOL implantation. This method allows quantitative in vivo determination of aqueous flare and aqueous particle concentration. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the following two treatment protocols: Protocol A: diclofenac 0.1% eyedrops and prednisolone 1% eyedrops (Inflanefran forte); protocol B: indomethacin 1% eyedrops (Chibro-Amuno 3) and prednisolone 1% eyedrops. One drop of either drug was administered 4 times per day to each patient. Treatment with nonsteroidal agents started on the day before surgery, whereas prednisolone treatment started immediately at the end of surgery. No parabulbar or oral steroids were administered.
In group A (diclofenac and prednisolone), the flare (in photon counts/ms) increased from a preoperative value of 10 +/- 4.3 (mean +/- SD) to 36.7 +/- 19.3 on the 1st postoperative day. This value is significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in group B (indomethacin and prednisolone) on the 1st postoperative day: 27.4 +/- 9.4.

In the early postoperative period after cataract surgery, the anti-inflammatory effect of a topical combination therapy with diclofenac and prednisolone is weaker than that of indomethacin and prednisolone.

Corneal thickness increased significantly in the retained Viscoat group, but this was not significant clinically. The retained Viscoat group had more patients with a postoperative IOP greater than 30 mm Hg and a greater mean increase in postoperative IOP, although the difference between the groups was not significant. The IOP changes may have been caused by blockage of the trabecular meshwork by the retained Viscoat.

However, BCCA decreased slightly with increasing pupil size in each group, and differences between 2.00 mm and 6.0 mm pupils were significant at each contrast level. In all bifocal groups, BCCA decreased significantly with increasing pupil size and also decreased with increasing corneal astigmatism; differences were significant at most pupil sizes and contrasts tested. In Group 1, BCCA was lower in eyes with bifocal IOLs than in eyes with monofocal IOLs at 25% and 11% contrast with a 2.5, 3.5, and 6.0 mm pupil; with a 2.0 mm pupil it did not differ significantly.

The haptics are more flexible than existing loops and the design of the lens is based on a concept of minimum loop rigidity; that is, a haptic that is rigid enough to support the weight of a lens in aqueous within the capsular bag is considered adequate for modern cataract surgery. I evaluated the lens design's safety and efficacy. Excluding patients with pre-existing macular degeneration, the corrected acuity of all patients at last follow-up was 20/40 or better in 100%, 20/30 or better in 95%, 20/25 to 20/20 or better in 85%, and 20/15 or better in 15%. The new haptic can accommodate compression of the capsular bag and allows early, reliable fixation. The centration of the lens was excellent early in the postoperative period and later after capsular fibrosis developed.";;;;;10.1016/s0886-3350(13)80038-7;1994-01-01;[{'lastname': 'Barrett', 'firstname': 'G D', 'initials': 'GD', 'affiliation': 'Lions Eye Institute, Perth, Western Australia.'}]
1104;7912576;Ibopamine: a new preoperative mydriatic for cataract surgery.;[];European journal of ophthalmology;Ibopamine is a dopaminergic mydriatic of proven use for fundoscopy. This double-blind prospective trial assessed its efficacy and safety as a preoperative mydriatic agent. 105 patients undergoing extracapsular cataract surgery were randomly allocated to receive Ibopamine 1%, Ibopamine 1% with Cyclopentolate 1%, or the control Phenylephrine 10% with Cyclopentolate 1%. Ibopamine alone achieved good mydriasis prior to anaesthesia, but this was not maintained intraoperatively. Cyclopentolate combined with Ibopamine, produced consistently greater mydriasis than when combined with Phenylephrine, but the difference became less marked as surgery continued. Analysis in relation to the stage of surgery showed that the greatest stimulus to miosis occurred during expression of the nucleus. Pulse rate and blood pressure in the 51 local anaesthetic cases showed no significant difference between the treatment groups, and there was no significant variation from baseline. The incidence of local side effects was similar in the three groups, and there were no systemic symptoms attributable to the drops. In conclusion, Ibopamine is a safe and effective mydriatic agent for cataract surgery, when used in combination with Cyclopentolate.;;;;;10.1177/112067219400400106;1994-01-01;[{'lastname': 'Corbett', 'firstname': 'M C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, U.K.'}, {'lastname': 'Buckley', 'firstname': 'S A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Richards', 'firstname': 'A B', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': None}]

Currently, three techniques of intraocular lens (IOL) fixation during penetrating keratoplasty for this condition are commonly used--flexible anterior chamber IOL (AC IOL) implantation, iris suture fixation of a posterior chamber IOL (PC IOL), and transscleral suture fixation of a PC IOL. This study represents the first prospective, randomized comparison of these three techniques.
One hundred seventy-six consecutive patients with pseudophakic corneal edema who underwent penetrating keratoplasty with IOL exchange were randomized to one of the three implantation techniques. Standardized evaluations were performed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively. Life-table analysis provided cumulative risk estimates for specific complications.
Randomization produced comparable groups at baseline. The cumulative risk of macular edema was significantly less for the iris fixation cohort than for either the AC IOL or scleral fixation group.

Best corrected distance acuity was 20/40 or better in 96% and 98%, respectively. Near acuity was 20/30 or better in 93% and 92% with near add, in 64% and 69% uncorrected, and in 79% and 78% with distance correction, respectively.

Of the patients with a monofocal fellow eye, 96% rated their distance vision with glasses in the monofocal eye as good, compared with 78% in the bifocal eye. The True Vista IOL favors distance vision while near acuity is still sufficient. As high image contrast at distance is usually more important than at near, this might be a good compromise.

One eye had intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) with a Choyce-IX anterior chamber lens (ACL) and the fellow eye extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with a posterior chamber lens (PCL). To evaluate the cystoid macular edema (CME), a fluorescence angiogram was recorded on the day of discharge and after 6 months. The severity of the CME was classified in three stages (degrees I-III). At discharge, no eye had CME grade III. CME grade I or grade II was seen in the ICCE group in 23% and in the ECCE group in 7.6%. After 6 months one eye of each group showed CME grade III (1.5%). CME grades I and II were seen after ICCE in 13.8% and 7.8% while the eyes with ECCE presented CME in 6.1% of grade I and of grade II, respectively. Visual acuity (VA) in the eyes with grades I and II CME was the same as in eyes without CME. The VA (median) of the ICCE group was 0.8 and of the ECCE 0.7. Because of infection of the capsular bag (toxic lens syndrome), in one case the PCL together with the capsular bag had to be explanted after 7 months. As for visual acuity and clinically significant CME (grade III), there was no statistical difference between ICCE plus Choyce-IX ACL eyes versus ECCE plus PCL eyes in the same patient.;;;;;;1993-08-01;[{'lastname': 'Quentin', 'firstname': 'C D', 'initials': 'CD', 'affiliation': 'Universitäts-Augenklinik, Universität Göttingen.'}, {'lastname': 'Behrens-Baumann', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lindemann', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hilgers', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vogel', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]

Differences between VF and 3M were significant (P = 0.05; t-test). CA at near focus was significantly lower than at distance focus with TV and VF (TV: P = 0.0001; VF: P = 0.005). Pseudoaccommodation was 4.5 D with TV and 3M and 3D with VF. In conclusion, distance CA was best with VF but pseudoaccommodation was not sufficient for reading.

The first group of 50 patients (50 eyes) received a convex-plane (plano-posterior) intraocular lens (IOL) with a continuous 360 degrees-laser ridge. The second group of 50 patients (50 eyes) received a convex-plane (plano-posterior) IOL without laser ridge. The follow-up investigations were carried out after 10 days, 2 months, 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years. Parameters such as the state of intraocular irritation, the intraocular pressure and astigmatism were also registered during the first six months after the operation.

Our clinical experience with ICCE and ACL implantation can not confirm the widespread rejection of this method.
A prospective, randomized, clinical study with participation of medical statisticians was performed. A total of 190 patients with ICCE and ACL and 170 patients with ECCE and PCL were followed up for 2 years. The follow-up examinations were performed upon dismission from the hospital, after 6, 12 and 24 months. The data were compiled in a computer program designed for this study and evaluated by the statisticians. The surgical procedures and the surgeons were defined prior to the beginning of patient recruitment.
ICCE with ACL shows much less postoperative complications as usually emphasized. There were only 2 (1.2%) of retinal detachment and no case of corneal decompensation. Cystoid macular edema 8 (4.7%), postoperative vitreous prolaps into the anterior chamber 4 (2.3%) and spontaneous complaints of pain 16 (9.4%) occurred in a low percentage after ICCE with ACL.

Patients were selected for study if they had absence of preoperative pathology, were at least 60 years of age, and had a reasonable postoperative prognosis. Extensive evaluations took place at 4 to 6 months and 12 to 14 months after surgery, including five different visual acuity measurements and contrast sensitivity. All testing was completed on both eyes. Data from the fellow eye served as a control when implanted with a monofocal IOL.
Overall uncorrected distance visual acuity at 1 year after surgery shows 57% patients with 20/40 or better acuity. In this same group, 78% achieved J3 or better near vision, which improved to 82% in the best case group. Uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better and J3 or better was achieved by 50% of best case multifocal IOL patients, compared with 26% of the monofocal best case comparison group. Measurements of contrast sensitivity consistently document a small loss, which is considered clinically insignificant. Statistical analysis of satisfaction ratings shows that predictors of satisfaction include uncorrected distance acuity, final near acuity, and fellow eye spherical equivalent.
This multifocal lens appears to work very well for most patients, with more than half having functional uncorrected distance and near vision.

All subjects had a manual extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. Eyes were evaluated at the end of surgery and 24 hours later. The collagen shield achieved a progressive effect on pain and a decrease in conjunctival redness after 24 hours. The occurrence of folds in Descemet's membrane was less frequent and aqueous flare less severe than when subconjunctival injections were used. No adverse effect was reported.

1153;1497527;Effect of continuous circular capsulorhexis and intraocular lens fixation on the blood-aqueous barrier.;[];Archives of ophthalmology (Chicago, Ill. : 1960);Permeability across the blood-aqueous barrier to fluorescein was estimated fluorophotometrically in pseudophakic eyes for which a continuous circular capsulorhexis was performed. The permeability index was significantly higher in the in-the-bag fixations than in the out-of-the-bag fixations at 3 and 6 months after surgery, when only bilateral cases were enrolled. Damage to the barrier in eyes with the in-the-bag fixations was attributable to the broad attachment of optics to the anterior capsule, because a positive linear regression was obtained between the permeability index and the doughnut-shaped contact area in eyes with the in-the-bag fixations. The permeability index in eyes with the in-the-bag fixations was as low as that in eyes with the out-of-the-bag fixations when the contact area was small. These results indicate an unfavorable effect of the in-the-bag fixation with broad contact of the optics with the anterior capsule and, thus, suggest either an in-the-bag fixation with a large capsulorhexis or an out-of-the-bag fixation.;;;;;10.1001/archopht.1992.01080200104035;1992-08-01;[{'lastname': 'Tsuboi', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Ophthalmology, Tane Memorial Eye Hospital, Osaka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsujioka', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kusube', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kojima', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]
1154;1414299;The effect of indomethacin 1% ophthalmic suspension on the pupil during extracapsular cataract surgery.;[];Acta ophthalmologica;Fifty-six patients who underwent extracapsular cataract surgery were randomized in two groups with 28 patients in each group. Group 1 was treated with standard preoperative dilation regime and group 2 received in addition indomethacin 1% ophthalmic solution. Horizontal and vertical pupil diameter measurements were taken before capsulotomy, before exprimation of the lens nucleus and before lens implantation. The size of the pupil at the time of capsulotomy and at the time just before lens exprimation was greatest in the non-indomethacin treated group, but at the time of lens implantation the pupil of the indomethacin treated group was greatest. It is concluded that even though indomethacin seems to be able to inhibit surgically induced miosis, probably through its inhibitory effect on prostaglandin synthesis, the effect is only marginal and from a clinical point of view it cannot be recommended.;;;;;10.1111/j.1755-3768.1992.tb02124.x;1992-08-01;[{'lastname': 'Gregersen', 'firstname': 'P L', 'initials': 'PL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Sønderborg Hospital, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Nielsen', 'firstname': 'P J', 'initials': 'PJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mortensen', 'firstname': 'K K', 'initials': 'KK', 'affiliation': None}]

Topical 1% apraclonidine was applied to 20 patients who underwent extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior intraocular lens implantation. On another 20 patients, who acted as control group a placebo (artificial tears) was given. The IOP was measured before preoperative medication and postoperatively at 6, 12 and 24 h, using the Perkins hand-held applanation tonometer.

The difference in frequency of intraocular hypertension between the groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.02). The statistical analysis showed that the postoperative IOP of operated treated eyes was significantly smaller than the IOP of operated control eyes.

1161;1501083;Effect of posterior chamber intraocular lens design and surgical placement on postoperative outcome.;[];Journal of cataract and refractive surgery;Intraocular lens (IOL) design, optical configuration, and placement have potential effects on postoperative outcome. Laboratory studies have suggested that one-piece, biconvex designs may reduce or delay posterior capsular opacification and that in-the-bag fixation of the posterior chamber IOL may reduce inflammation. To document the clinical significance of IOL design and placement, we conducted a randomized, prospective, clinical trial. Six hundred uncomplicated capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification patients were randomized in a three-factor design to receive an IOL that was one-piece or three-piece, had a biconvex, plano-convex, or laser ridge optic, and was bag-or sulcus-fixated. Treatment differences were related to lens placement. Patients with bag-fixated IOLs had less posterior capsular opacification, fewer YAG laser capsulotomies, a higher percentage of centered lenses, less inflammation, and fewer late posterior capsular striae than those with sulcus-fixated IOLs. In the latter group, patients with three-piece IOLs had fewer posterior capsular striae at three months postoperatively. All six occurrences of haptic loop distortion were in patients with three-piece IOLs. Patients with the one-piece design had less late inflammation than those with the three-piece design. Fewer YAG capsulotomies were necessary at one year in patients with the biconvex design than in those with the plano-convex or laser ridge configurations.

Early studies have reported variables amounts of decreased visual acuity and contrast sensitivity with multifocal IOLs, and some patients have experienced halos and glare.
The authors performed a prospective, double-masked, multicenter evaluation of 62 patients randomized between a new zonal-progressive optic multifocal IOL and a monofocal IOL.
Mean postoperative spherical equivalent, astigmatism, and uncorrected and best-corrected distance visual acuity were similar between the two groups. Patients with a multifocal IOL achieved significantly better uncorrected near visual acuity than patients with monofocal IOLs (J3+ versus J7; P less than 0.0001). With distance correction only, mean near visual acuity was J2 versus J5- (P = 0.0001). Best-corrected near visual acuity was J1 for both groups, with 1.36 diopters (D) for the multifocal group versus 2.37 D for the monofocal group (P less than 0.0001). Regan contrast sensitivity was lower for the multifocal patients at all contrast levels, and achieved statistical significance at very low contrast (11% contrast; P = 0.0024). Fifty-two percent of patients with a multifocal IOL reported that they did not need spectacles at all or used them only for their fellow eye, compared with 25% of the patients with monofocal IOLs.
Both monofocal and multifocal implant patients were very satisfied with the results of their cataract extraction and IOL implant surgery.

Twenty-two cases were combined with trabeculectomy and ten with keratoplasty using a temporary keratoprosthesis. Mean follow-up was six months.

The Space Eikonometer correctly measured the magnitude of induced aniseikonia in the normal subjects. The simulation test did not show underestimation in the eight normal subjects. We could not attribute the NAT's underestimation of aniseikonia to the red/green anaglyph method, printing error, psychophysical method, or the direct-comparison test format.

The True Vista IOL, a three-zone refractive bifocal IOL with central and peripheral distance zones and a pericentral near annulus, was implanted in 367 patients in a prospective European multicenter study between February 1990 and May 1991. Visual acuity, pupil size and astigmatism were determined. At 4-6 months near acuity was measured with reading charts (Nieden Chart) and at 7-11 months with a Snellen chart (Lighthouse Chart). At 4-6 (7-11) months, so far 164 (73) of the patients have been available for follow-up. Best corrected distance acuity was 20/40 or better in 97% (99%), best corrected near acuity was 20/30 or better in 91% (83%), and uncorrected near acuity was 20/30 or better in 64% (59%). Average Snellen near acuity (Lighthouse Chart) was 20/25, slightly lower than the average reading acuity of 20/22 (Nieden Chart) (p = 0.34, Wilcoxontest). Distance and near acuity also decreased with increasing astigmatism and increasing age. Our results demonstrate good visual acuities with the True Vista bifocal IOL.

1169;1574284;The effect of diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution on intraocular pressure following cataract extraction.;[];Ophthalmic surgery;Ninety-two nonglaucomatous patients undergoing extracapsular cataract extraction with implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens by residents at a Veterans hospital were randomized in double-masked fashion to receive either a topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent, diclofenac sodium 0.1%, or a placebo consisting of vehicle only. One drop of placebo or diclofenac sodium 0.1% was administered on an inpatient basis by trained staff every 6 hours for three doses, starting the afternoon prior to surgery. A further drop was given at 90, 60, 30, and 15 minutes before the operation. Starting 24 hours after surgery, all patients received diclofenac sodium 0.1%. All patients remained hospitalized for 72 hours postoperatively. Mean baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14.0 and 14.1 mm Hg in the diclofenac and placebo groups, respectively. IOP rose 8.6 mm Hg in both groups at 6 hours after surgery. At 24 hours, the mean IOP elevation from baseline was 11.3 mm Hg in the diclofenac group and 9.6 mm Hg in the placebo group (P = .47). Within the first 24 hours, IOP spiked more than 10 mm Hg in 57% (26/46) of the diclofenac patients and in 54% (25/46) of the placebo patients.

Many pharmacological agents have been used to prevent this IOP rise. We conducted a two-phase, randomized, prospective study to evaluate the natural behavior of IOP after cataract surgery and the effect of intraoperative intracameral carbachol on it. In phase 1, 102 cases were randomly assigned to three groups for recording IOP at 24, 48, or 72 hours after ECCE. The IOP at 24 (mean 20.3 mm Hg) and 48 hours (mean 22.3 mm Hg) was significantly higher than the preoperative IOP (mean 16.1 mm Hg); 26.3% of cases in group 1A (24 hours) and 44.1% of cases in group 1B (48 hours) had IOPs greater than or equal to 25 mm Hg.

The nylon group had the second highest amount of induced WTR cylinder at one day, which had decayed to ATR cylinder by five months. Between one and two years postoperatively, the nylon group experienced a significant ATR shift.

Twenty patients received one of the preparations topically to the surgically treated eye 5 times daily for a period of 5 days, beginning the day after surgery. Patients chosen for the study had no history of eye disease other than senile cataract nor of systemic diseases influencing the eyes.

In a randomized prospective double-blind clinical trial, Carteolol 2% suspended with frozen and thawed multivesicular large vesicles (FAT-MLV), FAT-MLV, and Carteolol 2% were applied to normal (slightly cataracterous) eyes and immediately after extracapsular cataract extraction or phakoemulsification with implantation of a posterior chamber lens in a standard procedure. Twenty-five patients were included in each group. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured for 3 days using applanation tonometry. In the normal eyes, a significant reduction of IOP was found for the patients receiving Carteolol and Carteolol MLV suspension. Moreover, an improved action and a prolongation of drug action was registered in the Carteolol/MLV group as compared to Carteolol treatment alone. After cataract operation, the control groups showed a significant increase in IOP. Carteolol produced a constant level of IOP but the Carteolol/MLV suspension showed a stronger decrease after ECCE and a still stronger decrease after phakoemulsification. Hence, Carteolol is suitable for the reduction of IOP but a Carteolol/MLV suspension is more effective, providing the possibility of a single application of a low-dose beta-blocker after cataract extraction with posterior chamber lens implantation.;;;;;10.1007/BF00154386;1992-01-01;[{'lastname': 'Weber', 'firstname': 'U', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Augenklinik des Akademischen Lehrkrankenhauses Braunschweig.'}, {'lastname': 'Bähr', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Michaelis', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mayer', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wirth', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}]

It is possible to detect the breakdown of the blood aqueous barrier 3 days after cataract surgery with this fluorophotometric method. Ocular inflammation is responsible for this leakage and non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs prevent this breakdown.

In 2 examination series, the acute and medium-term effects of RBA on the following ocular circulatory variables were investigated: ocular pulsation volume (PVoc), systolic ciliary and retinal perfusion pressures or blood pressures, respectively (method: oculo-oscillo-dynamography).
RBA with adrenaline: Directly after injection, PVoc was reduced by an average of 49%, the ocular perfusion and blood pressures were lowered by averages of 8.0 and 4.3 mmHg, respectively, and the intraocular pressure (Pio; hand-applanation tonometer) was elevated by 3.5 mmHg. 15 min after injection, PVoc and the ocular perfusion and blood pressures were even slightly more reduced, whereas Pio had reassumed its pre-injection level. RBA without adrenaline: During both time periods after injection, the reduction of PVoc averaged 10% less compared to RBA with adrenaline. The changes in ocular perfusion and blood pressures and in Pio, however, were not significantly different from RBA with adrenaline.
The lowering of PVoc--which variable is determined mainly by the pulsatile choroidal blood flow--in concert with the lowered ciliary perfusion and blood pressures is indicative of a reduced ciliary blood flow during RBA. Because of the decreased retinal perfusion and blood pressures, there is also a higher risk of reduced blood supply to the retina. Only to some degree, the observed inhibitory RBA effects on ocular circulation can be explained by adrenaline, and to an even smaller degree by the only transient Pio elevation.";;;"RBA with adrenaline: Directly after injection, PVoc was reduced by an average of 49%, the ocular perfusion and blood pressures were lowered by averages of 8.0 and 4.3 mmHg, respectively, and the intraocular pressure (Pio; hand-applanation tonometer) was elevated by 3.5 mmHg. 15 min after injection, PVoc and the ocular perfusion and blood pressures were even slightly more reduced, whereas Pio had reassumed its pre-injection level.

The principal advantages of this IOL are (a) faster visual rehabilitation, because postoperative astigmatism is reduced and more stable, and (b) less glare and color alteration than after implantation of PMMA lenses. These optical advantages may be due to the non-occurrence of optic decentration, the absence of positioning holes, the biconvex optic, the fact that the surface is less reflective than that of PMMA, and the Tyndall effect of the lens material.

Measurements are reported to be accurate to better than +/- 0.1 mm. Three biometry devices were compared in examinations of 159 persons, each examination being repeated several times. Axial length averaged 23.77 mm when measured by the immersion technique; applanation and modified applanation techniques yielded 0.1 mm and 0.3 mm shorter distances, respectively. Measured values of axial lengths did not have the same probability of being measured, even if they were close together. Results were not distributed in smooth Gaussian curves; on the contrary, clusters of values, on the pattern of our choice of ultrasound wavelength, were seen even when biometry was performed with electronic gates in the devices. Retest reliability decreased when short distances in the anterior segment of the eye were measured. Measurements of lens thickness were less readily reproducible in cataractous lenses than in healthy young eyes; anterior chamber depth, on the other hand, was measured more reliably in cataract patients. This last finding may have resulted in part from uncertainties about ultrasound velocity in the cataractous lens and in part from accommodation. In cataract patients, axial length was measured most reproducibly by the immersion technique; it was measured less accurately in young healthy eyes with a modified applanation device.";;;;;10.1016/s0886-3350(13)80737-7;1990-03-01;[{'lastname': 'Giers', 'firstname': 'U', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'University Eye Hospital, Ulm, West Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Epple', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}]
1232;2178597;Inhibition of blood-aqueous humor barrier breakdown with diclofenac. A fluorophotometric study.;[];Archives of ophthalmology (Chicago, Ill. : 1960);Various doses of a new topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, diclofenac sodium, were tested against prednisolone sodium phosphate in a randomized double-masked study to determine comparative efficacy and safety regarding the reduction of postsurgical ocular inflammation. Inflammation was assessed by measuring fluorescein leakage into the anterior chamber using fluorophotometry techniques. Increased leakage in each patient's operated-on eye compared with the unoperated-on control eye was attributed to a breakdown in the blood-aqueous barrier caused by the cataract surgery. Elimination or significant reduction of fluorescein leakage within a treatment group constituted increased efficacy in controlling inflammation. A total of 124 cases were analyzed. There were no preoperative differences among groups in fluorescein leakage. At 1 week after surgery, all three diclofenac groups had significantly less fluorescein leakage compared with the prednisolone group. Mean percent increases were 56% to 118% in diclofenac groups vs 324% in the prednisolone group. No differences among diclofenac concentrations were detected. The differences between prednisolone and diclofenac were also present, although of lesser magnitude, at 3 weeks. This demonstration of increased efficacy of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent vs prednisolone is promising given the known side effects of ocular steroids.;;;;;10.1001/archopht.1990.01070050078035;1990-03-01;[{'lastname': 'Kraff', 'firstname': 'M C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'JFK Eye Institute, Chicago, IL 60634.'}, {'lastname': 'Sanders', 'firstname': 'D R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'McGuigan', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Raanan', 'firstname': 'M G', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': None}]

All patients had senile cataracts. Endothelial specular microscopic assessment was performed preoperatively and postoperatively at six and 12 months. Viscoelastic agents were not used in any of the cases and upper haptic positioning was achieved with dialing and irrigation and iris retraction in each group, respectively. Major complications in both groups were iridocapsular synechias. This resulted in dislocation of a single haptic into the anterior chamber angle in one ciliary-sulcus-placed lens and in an updrawn pupil in one of the intercapsular cases. Pigment dispersion syndrome occurred in one case with a ciliary-sulcus-placed lens. In one case in each group a Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy was performed. Whereas the visual results in each group were similar, the percentage cell loss was significantly greater in the group with lenses in the ciliary sulcus at six months postoperatively.

Though functional results were comparable to those achieved with polymethylmethacrylate lenses, all eyes achieving a visual acuity of 20/40 or better, morphological results were less satisfactory. Because of hydrogel's lack of adhesiveness and the inability to estimate the individual sulcus diameter, pseudophakodonesis was a common observation.

The antiphlogistic action of diclofenac eyedrops versus placebo eyedrops in the prophylaxis of cystoid macular edema (CME) and postoperative inflammatory symptoms was therefore tested in a prospective randomized double-blind study. A total of 179 patients with intracapsular cataract operations and Choyce Mark IX anterior chamber lens implantation received 2 drops 5 times preoperatively and 1 drop 5 times postoperatively until they were discharged, and then subsequently for 6 months they used 1 drop of diclofenac or placebo eyedrops 3 times. To evaluate the CME, fluorescence angiography was carried out on all patients on the day of discharge, 6 weeks later, and after 6 months following the operation. The patients who completed the study according to plan numbered 112. With diclofenac eyedrops, significantly less CME occurred in comparison with treatment with placebo eyedrops (p = 0.03). Visual acuity improved faster and the postoperative inflammatory symptoms receded more quickly in the diclofenac group.;;;;;;1989-01-01;[{'lastname': 'Quentin', 'firstname': 'C D', 'initials': 'CD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Behrens-Baumann', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gaus', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}]

The patients judged not to need biometry were allocated randomly to two groups, one of which had biometry. The only significant clinical criterion for biometry was found to be the wearing of glasses since before the age of 30 years. Several unexpectedly high refractive errors occurred in the group of patients who did not have biometry. In the group of patients judged not to need biometry but allocated to the biometry group, refractive results were significantly better (nearer to target refractions) than in the unmeasured group. Routine pre-operative biometry is probably the only way to avoid unexpected high ametropia, and it also improves the refractive results.

Intraocular pressure, pupil size, and anterior chamber cellular reaction were measured in a masked fashion on the first day after surgery. A significant increase in intraocular pressure was found in all groups postoperatively when compared with baseline values (P less than .001). Eyes treated with pilocarpine gel had an average intraocular pressure increase of 4.2 +/- 2.1 mm Hg (mean +/- 1 S.E.), eyes treated with pilocarpine 4% eyedrops had an average increase of 9.8 +/- 2.8 mm Hg, and eyes treated with timolol demonstrated an intraocular pressure increase of 8.25 +/- 3.19. The intraocular pressure in untreated eyes (controls) increased by an average of 12.9 +/- 2.7 mm Hg. Only the difference in intraocular pressure change between the eyes treated with pilocarpine gel and control eyes was statistically significant (P = .025). Postsurgical intraocular pressure exceeding 25 mm Hg was observed in three of 20 pilocarpine gel treated eyes (15%) and 11 of 20 control eyes (55%).

Inflammation was assessed by clinical grading, and the breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier was evaluated by slit-lamp anterior segment fluorophotometry. Patients who used either or both anti-inflammatory agents had significantly less inflammation or blood-aqueous barrier breakdown than did those who used neither agent. Also, the use of both topical indomethacin and dexamethasone resulted in less fluorescein leakage during the second postoperative week than did the use of dexamethasone alone. Since this difference could not be detected by clinical measurement, we believe that fluorophotometry is a more sensitive quantitative measure. Clinical assessment of inflammation did correlate with fluorophotometric measurements, as patients with clinically unacceptable inflammation had 3.7 times more fluorescein leakage in the surgically treated eye than did patients with clinically acceptable inflammation.;;;;;10.1001/archopht.1984.01040031173012;1984-10-01;[{'lastname': 'Sanders', 'firstname': 'D R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kraff', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]

Forty patients were divided into four groups. In Group 1, there were 20 patients who underwent intracapsular cataract extraction, intraocular lens implantation, and penetrating keratoplasty. In Group 2, there were 10 patients who underwent intracapsular cataract extraction and corneal graft surgery. In Group 3, there were four patients with corneal dystrophy who underwent penetrating keratoplasty; and in Group 4, there were six patients with decompensated corneas who had intraocular lenses in situ and who underwent corneal replacement surgery. In each group, half of the patients randomly selected were treated with Healon, while the remaining patients served as controls and were treated with air/BSS. Healon treated recipients lost fewer endothelial cells and had thinner corneas than their control group counterparts. The intraocular pressure was slightly higher in the Healon group, but was easily controlled by proper medication. Healon was found to be beneficial to the patient and a safe adjunct in penetrating keratoplasty surgery.";;;;;;1984-09-01;[{'lastname': 'Alpar', 'firstname': 'J J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': None}]

A controlled clinical study.;[];Acta ophthalmologica;A controlled clinical study with random allocation of method of rehabilitation (lens implant or contact lenses) was designed for comparative outcome assessments. Sixty-one patients were included in the study: 31 patients randomized to lens implantation and 30 patients to extended-wear contact lens rehabilitation with early post-operative fitting. Complication rates were low in both groups with slight accumulation of intraocular complications in the implant group and of external complications in the contact lens group. We found no significant differences between the groups in final visual acuity, in vision dependent practical functioning, or in patients' contentment. Two main points summarize our results and impressions from this study: At the expense of a slightly higher risk the lens implant patients get the most convenient and comfortable rehabilitation and at the expense of frequent visits for follow-up and lens cleaning the contact lens patients get the safest rehabilitation. The patient offered contact lens rehabilitation should be capable of alert cooperation, fairly mobile and living within easy access to ophthalmic service, while the patient offered lens implant does not need to fulfill these criteria.;;;;;10.1111/j.1755-3768.1983.tb01436.x;1983-06-01;[{'lastname': 'Bernth-Petersen', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sørensen', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}]

1316;6964655;The selection of intraocular lens power by calculation and by reference to the refraction--a clinical study.;[];Transactions of the ophthalmological societies of the United Kingdom;Two hundred eyes each received a Rayner Binkhorst pupil-supported intraocular lens (IOL) after cataract extraction. One hundred received a standard power +19 D IOL and one hundred received an IOL of power calculated for emmetropia by the formula of R. D. Binkhorst using biometric data. Calculation reduced the incidence of postoperative refractive error greater than the +/- 2 D range from 20 per cent to 1 per cent virtually eliminating significant postoperative refractive error. Consideration of the preoperative refractions and the calculated IOL powers showed that there is no constant or reliable relationship. Twenty nine 'emmetropic' eyes were shown not to be 'normal' eyes but eyes with a wide range of axial lengths whose different optical components summated to give emmetropia. In the selection of IOL power, reference must be made to biometric data to allow for these optical components and for this reason IOL power cannot be determined from the preoperative refraction of the eye. The case for control of postoperative refraction by calculation of IOL power is a strong one and there appears little justification for the use of standard power IOLs with unpredictable refraction results.;;;;;;1982-01-01;[{'lastname': 'Hillman', 'firstname': 'J S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': None}]
