It is the second leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Treatment for glaucoma aims to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) to slow or prevent further vision loss. IOP can be lowered with medications, laser, or incisional surgery. Trabeculectomy is a surgical approach which lowers IOP by shunting aqueous humor to a subconjunctival bleb. Device-modified trabeculectomy techniques are intended to improve the durability and safety of this bleb-forming surgery. Trabeculectomy-modifying devices include the Ex-PRESS, the XEN Gel Stent, the PreserFlo MicroShunt, as well as antifibrotic materials such as Ologen, amniotic membrane, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane, Gelfilm and others. However, the comparative effectiveness and safety of these devices are uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of different devices as adjuncts to trabeculectomy on IOP control in eyes with glaucoma compared to standard trabeculectomy.
SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was August 2021.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials in participants with glaucoma comparing device-modified trabeculectomy techniques with standard trabeculectomy. We included studies that used antimetabolites in either or both treatment groups.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. change in IOP and 2. mean postoperative IOP at one year. Our secondary outcomes were 3. mean change in IOP from baseline, 4. mean postoperative IOP at any time point, 5. mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), 6. visual field change, 7. quality of life, 8. proportion of participants who are drop-free at one year, 9. mean number of IOP lowering medications at one year, and 10. proportion of participants with complications.
MAIN RESULTS: Eight studies met our inclusion criteria, of which seven were full-length journal articles and one was a conference abstract. The eight studies included 961 participants with glaucoma, and compared two types of devices implanted during trabeculectomy versus standard trabeculectomy. Seven studies (462 eyes, 434 participants) used the Ex-PRESS, and one study (527 eyes, 527 participants) used the PreserFlo MicroShunt. No studies using the XEN Gel Stent implantation met our criteria. The studies were conducted in North America, Europe, and Africa. Planned follow-up periods ranged from six months to five years. The studies were reported poorly, which limited our ability to judge risk of bias for many domains. None of the studies explicitly masked outcome assessment. We rated seven studies at high risk of detection bias. Low-certainty of evidence from five studies showed that using the Ex-PRESS plus trabeculectomy compared with standard trabeculectomy may be associated with a slightly lower IOP at one year (mean difference (MD) -1.76 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.81 to -0.70; 213 eyes). Moderate-certainty of evidence from one study showed that using the PreserFlo MicroShunt may be associated with a slightly higher IOP than standard trabeculectomy at one year (MD 3.20 mmHg, 95% CI 2.29 to 4.11). Participants who received standard trabeculectomy may have a higher risk of hypotony compared with those who received device-modified trabeculectomy, but the evidence is uncertain (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.17; I² = 38%; P = 0.14). In the subgroup of participants who received the PreserFlo MicroShunt, there was a lower risk of developing hypotony or shallow anterior chamber compared with those receiving standard trabeculectomy (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.79; 526 eyes). Device-modified trabeculectomy may lead to less subsequent cataract surgery within one year (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.80; I² = 0%).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Use of an Ex-PRESS plus trabeculectomy may produce greater IOP reduction at one-year follow-up than standard trabeculectomy; however, due to potential biases and imprecision in effect estimates, the certainty of evidence is low. PreserFlo MicroShunt may be inferior to standard trabeculectomy in lowering IOP. However, PreserFlo MicroShunt may prevent postoperative hypotony and bleb leakage. Overall, device-modified trabeculectomy appears associated with a lower risk of cataract surgery within five years compared with standard trabeculectomy. Due to various limitations in the design and conduct of the included studies, the applicability of this evidence synthesis to other populations or settings is uncertain. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of other devices in subgroup populations, such as people with different types of glaucoma, of various races and ethnicity, and with different lens types (e.g. phakic, pseudophakic)."
36884304;Lens extraction versus laser peripheral iridotomy for acute primary angle closure.;"{'D016428': 'Journal Article', 'D052061': 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'D013485': ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'D016454': 'Review'}";['Ong AY', 'McCann P', 'Perera SA', 'Lim F', 'Ng SM', 'Friedman DS', 'Chang D'];Cochrane Database Syst Rev;2023;10.1002/14651858.CD015116.pub2;"BACKGROUND: Acute primary angle closure (APAC) is a potentially blinding condition. It is one of the few ophthalmic emergencies and carries high rates of visual morbidity in the absence of timely intervention. Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) has been the standard of care thus far. However, LPI does not eliminate the long-term risk of chronic angle closure glaucoma and other associated sequelae. There has been increasing interest in lens extraction as the primary treatment for the spectrum of primary angle closure disease, and it is as yet unclear whether these results can be extrapolated to APAC, and whether lens extraction provides better long-term outcomes. We therefore sought to evaluate the effectiveness of lens extraction in APAC to help inform the decision-making process.  OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of lens extraction compared to LPI in the treatment of APAC.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2022, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE E-pub Ahead of Print, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily (January 1946 to 10 January 2022), Embase (January 1947 to 10 January 2022), PubMed (1946 to 10 January 2022), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to 10 January 2022), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search. We last searched the electronic databases on 10 January 2022.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled clinical trials comparing lens extraction against LPI in adult participants ( ≥ 35 years) with APAC in one or both eyes.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodology and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for prespecified outcomes using the GRADE approach.
MAIN RESULTS: We included two studies conducted in Hong Kong and Singapore, comprising 99 eyes (99 participants) of predominantly Chinese origin. The two studies compared LPI with phacoemulsification performed by experienced surgeons. We assessed that both studies were at high risk of bias. There were no studies evaluating other types of lens extraction procedures.  Phacoemulsification may result in an increased proportion of participants with intraocular pressure (IOP) control compared with LPI at 18 to 24 months (risk ratio (RR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 2.15; 2 studies, n = 97; low certainty evidence) and may reduce the need for further IOP-lowering surgery within 24 months (RR 0.07, 96% CI 0.01 to 0.51; 2 studies, n = 99; very low certainty evidence). Phacoemulsification may result in a lower mean IOP at 12 months compared to LPI (mean difference (MD) -3.20, 95% CI -4.79 to -1.61; 1 study, n = 62; low certainty evidence) and a slightly lower mean number of IOP-lowering medications at 18 months (MD -0.87, 95% CI -1.28 to -0.46; 1 study, n = 60; low certainty evidence), but this may not be clinically significant. Phacoemulsification may have little to no effect on the proportion of participants with one or more recurrent APAC episodes in the same eye (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.30; 1 study, n = 37; very low certainty evidence). Phacoemulsification may result in a wider iridocorneal angle assessed by Shaffer grading at six months (MD 1.15, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.47; 1 study, n = 62; very low certainty evidence). Phacoemulsification may have little to no effect on logMAR best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at six months (MD -0.09, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.02; 2 studies, n = 94; very low certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in the extent of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) (clock hours) between intervention arms at 6 months (MD -1.86, 95% CI -7.03 to 3.32; 2 studies, n = 94; very low certainty evidence), although the phacoemulsification group may have less PAS (degrees) at 12 months (MD -94.20, 95% CI -140.37 to -48.03; 1 study, n = 62) and 18 months (MD -127.30, 95% CI -168.91 to -85.69; 1 study, n = 60).  In one study, there were 26 adverse events in the phacoemulsification group: intraoperative corneal edema (n = 12), posterior capsular rupture (n = 1), intraoperative bleeding from iris root (n = 1), postoperative fibrinous anterior chamber reaction (n = 7), and visually significant posterior capsular opacification (n = 5), and no cases of suprachoroidal hemorrhage or endophthalmitis. There were four adverse events in the LPI group: closed iridotomy (n = 1) and small iridotomies that required supplementary laser (n = 3). In the other study, there was one adverse event in the phacoemulsification group (IOP > 30 mmHg on day 1 postoperatively (n = 1)), and no intraoperative complications. There were five adverse events in the LPI group: transient hemorrhage (n = 1), corneal burn (n = 1), and repeated LPI because of non-patency (n = 3).  Neither study reported health- or vision-related quality of life measures.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Low certainty evidence suggests that early lens extraction may produce more favorable outcomes compared to initial LPI in terms of IOP control. Evidence for other outcomes is less clear. Future high-quality and longer-term studies evaluating the effects of either intervention on the development of glaucomatous damage and visual field changes as well as health-related quality of life measures would be helpful."

METHODS: Systematic methods were used to search and collect the published literature on economic evaluations of cataracts. A mapping review of studies published in the following bibliographical databases was performed: the National Library of Medicine (PubMed), EMBASE, Web of Science (WOS), and the Central of Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) database. A descriptive analysis was conducted and relevant studies were classified into different groups.
RESULTS: Among 984 studies screened, 56 studies were included in the mapping review. Four research questions were answered. There has been a progressive increase of publications during the last decade. The majority of the included studies were published by authors from institutions in the USA and UK. The most commonly investigated area was cataract surgery followed by intraocular lenses (IOLs). The studies were classified into different categories according to the main outcome evaluated, such as comparisons between different surgical techniques, costs of the cataract surgery, second eye cataract surgery costs, quality of life gain after cataract surgery, waiting time of cataract surgery and costs, and cataract evaluation, follow-up, and costs. In the IOL classification, the most frequently studied area was the comparison between monofocal and multifocal IOLs, followed by the comparison between toric and monofocal IOLs.
CONCLUSIONS: Cataract surgery is a cost-effective procedure compared with other non-ophthalmic and ophthalmic interventions and surgery waiting time is an important factor to consider because vision loss has a huge and broad-ranging impact on society. Numerous gaps and inconsistencies are found among the studies included. For this reason, there is a need for further studies according to the classification described in the mapping review."
36745314;Rate of Complete Spectacle Independence with a Trifocal Intraocular Lens: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis.;{'D016428': 'Journal Article'};['Zhu D', 'Ren S', 'Mills K', 'Hull J', 'Dhariwal M'];Ophthalmol Ther;2023;10.1007/s40123-023-00657-5;"INTRODUCTION: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted to identify and obtain a precise single summary estimate on complete spectacle independence after bilateral implantation of a trifocal intraocular lens (IOL) (AcrySof PanOptix, TFNTXX/TFATXX) for patients undergoing cataract surgery.
METHODS: A search was conducted in PubMed from January 2017 to September 2021. Relevant congress presentations were also searched to include data from completed studies not yet published. Search terms included the intervention (TFNTXX, TFATXX, PanOptix) and outcomes of interest (patient-reported spectacle independence rates). A Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis was conducted, providing a pooled estimate (median and its 95% credible interval) of complete spectacle independence rates among cataract surgery patients. Subgroup analyses evaluated spectacle independence after cataract surgery across different working distances (near, intermediate, far).
RESULTS: Nineteen unique clinical studies were identified. Based on a meta-analysis of 13 studies (N = 513 patients), the complete spectacle independence rate after cataract surgery with TFNTXX/TFATXX IOL was 91.6% (95% credible interval 86.8-95.9%). Additionally, the spectacle independence rates at each focal point (N = 13 studies, 603 patients) were 89.6% (near), 96.3% (intermediate), and 95.9% (far).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrated that at least nine out of ten patients receiving TFNTXX/TFATXX trifocal IOL during cataract surgery can expect to achieve complete spectacle independence. This study provides informative data for clinicians and patients to feel confident in the use of trifocal intraocular lenses as presbyopia-correcting IOLs that offer high rates of complete spectacle independence."
36705482;Trifocal intraocular lenses versus bifocal intraocular lenses after cataract extraction among participants with presbyopia.;{'D016428': 'Journal Article', 'D052061': 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'D016454': 'Review', 'D000078182': 'Systematic Review'};['Zamora-de La Cruz D', 'Bartlett J', 'Gutierrez M', 'Ng SM'];Cochrane Database Syst Rev;2023;10.1002/14651858.CD012648.pub3;"BACKGROUND: Presbyopia occurs when the lens of the eyes loses its elasticity leading to loss of accommodation. The lens may also progress to develop cataract, affecting visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. One option of care for individuals with presbyopia and cataract is the use of multifocal or extended depth of focus intraocular lens (IOL) after cataract surgery. Although trifocal and bifocal IOLs are designed to restore three and two focal points respectively, trifocal lens may be preferable because it restores near, intermediate, and far vision, and may also provide a greater range of useful vision and allow for greater spectacle independence in individuals with presbyopia.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of implantation with trifocal versus bifocal IOLs during cataract surgery among people with presbyopia.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2022, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 31 March 2022.  SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials that compared trifocal and bifocal IOLs among participants 30 years of age or older with presbyopia undergoing cataract surgery.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodology and graded the certainty of the body of evidence according to the GRADE classification.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified seven studies conducted in Europe and Turkey with a total of 331 participants. All included studies assessed visual acuity using a logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR chart). Of them, six (86%) studies assessed uncorrected distance visual acuity (the primary outcome of this review). Some studies also examined our secondary outcomes including uncorrected near, intermediate, and best-corrected distance visual acuity, as well as contrast sensitivity. Study characteristics All participants had bilateral cataracts with no pre-existing ocular pathologies or ocular surgery. Participants' mean age ranged from 55 to 74 years. Three studies reported on gender of participants, and they were mostly women. We assessed all of the included studies as being at unclear risk of bias for most domains. Two studies received financial support from manufacturers of lenses evaluated in this review, and at least one author of another study reported receiving payments for delivering lectures with lens manufacturers. Findings All studies compared trifocal versus bifocal IOL implantation on visual acuity outcomes measured on a LogMAR scale. At one year, trifocal IOL showed no evidence of effect on uncorrected distance visual acuity (mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.04 to 0.04; I
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found low-certainty of evidence that compared with bifocal IOL, implantation of trifocal IOL may improve uncorrected intermediate visual acuity at one year. However, there was no evidence of a difference between trifocal and bifocal IOL for uncorrected distance visual acuity, uncorrected near visual acuity, and best-corrected visual acuity at one year. Future research should include the comparison of both trifocal IOL and specific bifocal IOLs that correct intermediate visual acuity to evaluate important outcomes such as contrast sensitivity, quality of life, and vision-related adverse effects."
36595831;Systematic review of the efficacy and safety of stage I or II IOL implantation in patients with diabetic retinopathy.;{'D000078182': 'Systematic Review', 'D017418': 'Meta-Analysis', 'D016428': 'Journal Article'};['Meng B', 'Li S', 'Wang K', 'Huang Y', 'Wang Y', 'Zhao L'];Medicine (Baltimore);2022;10.1097/MD.0000000000032406;"BACKGROUND: Intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is required after vitrectomy combined with cataract surgery in diabetic retinopathy patients. However, the question of whether an IOL should be implanted in stage I after vitrectomy or stage II during silicone oil filling has been controversial, and there has been no systematic review of this clinical issue.
METHODS: WanFang, SinoMed CNKI, VIP, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for relevant studies. The deadline was May 8, 2021. All studies of stage I or II IOL implantation in patients with diabetes who underwent vitrectomy were included. Revman 5.3 software was used for the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Four studies, involving 253 eyes, were included. This study analyzed the literature with a common outcome index by meta-analysis and systematically evaluated the literature without a common outcome index. Four studies compared the efficacy and safety of the 2 sequential surgical methods in patients with diabetic retinopathy. The results of the meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the efficacy and safety of stage II IOL implantation when compared with stage I IOL implantation (P > .05). One study showed that stage II cataract surgery with oil extraction resulted in better postoperative visual acuity and fewer complications than stage I cataract surgery with vitrectomy. One study showed that stage II IOL implantation during oil extraction had better postoperative visual acuity than stage I IOL implantation during vitrectomy without increasing surgical complications.
CONCLUSION: Vitrectomy combined with stage II IOL implantation is safer and more effective than stage I in patients with diabetic retinopathy; however, more clinical studies are needed to verify this."

The condition is characterised by purulent inflammation of the intraocular fluids caused by an infective agent. In exogenous endophthalmitis, the infective agent is foreign and typically introduced into the eye through intraocular surgery or open globe trauma.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential role of combined pars plana vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotics in the acute management of exogenous endophthalmitis, versus the standard of care, defined as vitreous tap and intravitreal antibiotics.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2022, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry; ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. The date of the search was 5 May 2022.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared pars plana vitrectomy and intravitreal injection of antibiotics versus intravitreal injection of antibiotics alone, for the immediate management of exogenous endophthalmitis.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened search results and extracted data. We considered the following outcomes: visual acuity improvement and change in visual acuity at three and six months; additional surgical procedures, including vitrectomy and cataract surgery, at any time during follow-up; quality of life and adverse effects. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.  MAIN RESULTS: We identified a single RCT that met our inclusion criteria. The included RCT enrolled a total of 420 participants with clinical evidence of endophthalmitis, within six weeks of cataract surgery or secondary intraocular lens implantation. Participants were randomly assigned according to a 2 x 2 factorial design to either treatment with vitrectomy (VIT) or vitreous tap biopsy (TAP) and to treatment with or without systemic antibiotics. Twenty-four participants did not have a final follow-up: 12 died, five withdrew consent to be followed up, and seven were not willing to return for the visit.  The study did not report visual acuity according to the review's predefined outcomes. At three months, 41% of all participants achieved 20/40 or better visual acuity and 69% had 20/100 or better acuity. The study authors reported that there was no statistically significant difference in visual acuity between treatment groups (very low-certainty evidence). There was low-certainty evidence of a similar requirement for additional surgical procedures (risk ratio RR 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.21). Adverse effects included: VIT group: dislocated intraocular lens (n = 2), macular infarction (n = 1). TAP group: expulsive haemorrhage (n = 1). Quality of life and mean change in visual acuity were not reported.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified a single RCT (published 27 years ago) for the role of early vitrectomy in exogenous endophthalmitis, which suggests that there may be no difference between groups (VIT vs TAP) for visual acuity at three or nine months' follow-up.   We are of the opinion that there is a clear need for more randomised studies comparing the role of primary vitrectomy in exogenous endophthalmitis. Moreover, since the original RCT study, there have been incremental changes in the surgical techniques with which vitrectomy is performed. Such advances are likely to influence the outcome of early vitrectomy in exogenous endophthalmitis."

METHODS: This prospective cohort study was performed among patients underwent toric IOL (AT TORBI 709 M) implantation with or without CTR at the Eye and ENT hospital between April 2020 and November 2021. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance baseline factors. Postoperatively, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCVA) and residual astigmatism, as well as IOLs' rotation, tilt, and decentration, were analyzed. Grouped multiple linear regression analysis was used to model predictive factors of rotation in each group. Additionally, a meta-analysis of data from 4 publications (284 eyes) and current study was performed to evaluate the effect of CTR co-implantation on toric IOL rotation.
RESULTS: After PSM, 126 eyes from each group were included for further analysis. Postoperatively, UDVA was 0.31 ± 0.38 logMAR and 0.27 ± 0.36 logMAR in the CTR and NCTR groups, respectively (P = 0.441), and residual astigmatism was 0.75 ± 0.52 D and 0.86 ± 0.65 D, respectively (P = 0.139). The rotation of toric IOL was significantly smaller in the CTR group than in the NCTR group (4.63 ± 6.27 vs. 10.93 ± 16.05 degrees, P < 0.001). The regression models of the two groups and the coefficients of LT were significantly different (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, the meta-analysis confirmed that CTR co-implantation reduced toric IOL rotation (MD, - 1.59; 95% CI, - 3.10 to - 0.09; P = 0.038).
CONCLUSION: CTR enhances rotational stability of toric IOL by reducing the impact of LT, and CTR co-implantation is recommended in patients with lens thickness (LT) ≥ 4.5 mm, white-to-white (WTW) ≥ 11.6 mm, or high preexisting astigmatism."

METHODS: Four databases, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and Cochrane library, were searched to select relevant studies published between Apr 11, 2011, and Apr 11, 2021. Axial myopic eyes were defined as an axial length more than 24.5 mm. There are 13 formulae to participate in the final comparison (SRK/T, Hoffer Q, Holladay I, Holladay II, Haigis for traditional formulae, Barrett Universal II, Olsen, T2, VRF, EVO, Kane, Hill-RBF, LSF for the new-generation formulae). The primary outcomes were the percentage of eyes with a refractive prediction error in ± 0.5D and ± 1.0D.
RESULTS: A total of 2273 eyes in 15 studies were enrolled in the final meta-analysis. Overall, the new-generation formulae showed a relatively more accurate outcome in comparison with traditional formulae. The percentage of eyes with a predictive refraction error in ± 0.5D (± 1.0D) of Kane, EVO and LSF was higher than 80% (95%), which was only significantly different from Hoffer Q (all P < 0.05). Moreover, another two new-generation formulae, Barrett Universal II and Olsen, had higher percentages than SRK/T, Hoffer Q, Holladay I and Haigis for eyes with predictive refraction error in ± 0.5D and ± 1.0D (all P < 0.05). In ± 0.5D group, Hill-RBF was better than SRK/T (P = 0.02), and Holladay I was better than EVO (P = 0.03) and LSF (P = 0.009), and Hoffer Q had a lower percentage than EVO, Kane, Hill-RBF and LSF (P = 0.007, 0.004, 0.002, 0.03, respectively). Barrett Universal II was better than T2 (P = 0.02), and Hill-RBF was better than SRK/T (P = 0.009). No significant difference was found in other pairwise comparison.
CONCLUSION: The new-generation formula is more accurate in intraocular lens power calculation for axial myopic eyes in comparison with the third- or fourth-generation formula."

There is a lack of consensus regarding their comparative efficacy and safety. This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety outcomes after scleral-fixated (SF) vs iris-fixated (IF) IOL implantation or fixation in adults. A systematic literature search was conducted on Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL from 2005 to 2020. 785 eyes from 2 randomized controlled trials and 9 nonrandomized studies were included. There was no significant difference in the mean corrected distance visual acuity at the final follow-up ( P = .52) or absolute change in spherical equivalent ( P = .88) between SF IOL and IF IOL implantation. The incidence of vitreous hemorrhage was significantly higher in the SF IOL group (risk ratio = 3.66, 95% CI, 1.16-11.55, P = .03). There were no differences in visual acuity and refractive outcomes between SF IOL and IF IOL implantation or fixation. Trade-offs in complications exist between the 2 techniques.

METHODS: We searched Pubmed, Embase and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (inception to January 20, 2021). Two researchers extracted data and assessed paper quality independently. Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) before and after surgery, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) before and after surgery, preoperative cylinder, postoperative residual refractive cylinder, postoperative corneal cylinder, IOL misalignment, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were compared.
RESULTS: We included 14 studies with 885 cataract eyes. All data were performed using Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3) (https://revman.cochrane.org/). Cases of all preoperative outcomes showed no significant difference between image-guided group and manual group. There was no significant difference in postoperative UDVA (Standard mean difference (SMD: -0.11, 95% CI: -0.32 to 0.11, 
CONCLUSION: Image-guided systems can improve the effect in phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation."
