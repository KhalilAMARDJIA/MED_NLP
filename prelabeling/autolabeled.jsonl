The purpose was to investigate the effect of cataract surgery on circadian photoentrainment and to determine any difference between blue-blocking and neutral intraocular lenses (IOLs).\nThe study was a single-center, investigator-driven, double-masked, block-randomized clinical trial.\nOne eye in 76 patients with bilateral age-related cataract eligible for cataract surgery was included.\nIntervention was cataract surgery by phacoemulsification. Patients were randomized to receive a blue-blocking or neutral IOL.\nPrimary outcome was activation of intrinsic photosensitive ganglion cells using post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) to blue light from 10 to 30 seconds after light exposure as a surrogate measure. Secondary outcomes were circadian rhythm analysis using actigraphy and 24-hour salivary melatonin measurements. Finally, objective and subjective sleep quality were determined by actigraphy and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.\nThe blue light PIPR increased 2 days (17%) and 3 weeks (24%) after surgery (P < 0.001). The majority of circadian and sleep-specific actigraphy parameters did not change after surgery. A forward shift of the circadian rhythm by 22 minutes (P = 0.004) for actigraphy and a tendency toward an earlier melatonin onset (P = 0.095) were found. Peak salivary melatonin concentration increased after surgery (P = 0.037).

Because of inconsistency between the significant findings and the many parameters that were unchanged, we can conclude that cataract surgery does not adversely affect the circadian rhythm or sleep.

In addition to UDVA, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), residual astigmatism, stability of the IOL alignment, need of realignment, and the rate of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy were evaluated up to 1 year postoperatively.

Infants were either left aphakic (n = 53) or had an intraocular lens implanted (n = 55). Patching was prescribed 1 hour per day per month of age until 8 months of age and 50% of waking hours thereafter. Adherence was measured as the mean percentage of prescribed patching reported in a 7-day diary completed 2 months after surgery, and 48-hour recall interviews conducted 3 and 6 months after surgery. Grating visual acuity was measured within 1 month of the infant's first birthday (n = 108) using Teller Acuity Cards by a tester masked to treatment. Nonparametric correlations were used to examine the relationship with grating acuity.\nOn average, caregivers reported patching 84.3% (SD = 31.2%) of prescribed time and adherence did not differ by treatment (t = -1.40, df = 106, p = 0.16).

{"id": 375, "text": "Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness. Although primary open-angle glaucoma is more common, primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is more likely to result in irreversible blindness. By 2020, 5·3 million people worldwide will be blind because of PACG. The current standard care for PACG is a stepped approach of a combination of laser iridotomy surgery (to open the drainage angle) and medical treatment (to reduce intraocular pressure). If these treatments fail, glaucoma surgery (eg, trabeculectomy) is indicated. It has been proposed that, because the lens of the eye plays a major role in the mechanisms leading to PACG, early clear lens extraction will improve glaucoma control by opening the drainage angle. This procedure might reduce the need for drugs and glaucoma surgery, maintain good visual acuity, and improve quality of life compared with standard care.EAGLE aims to evaluate whether early lens extraction improves patient-reported, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness, compared with standard care.\nEAGLE is a multicentre pragmatic randomized trial. All people presenting to the recruitment centres in the UK and east Asia with newly diagnosed PACG and who are at least 50 years old are eligible.The primary outcomes are EQ-5D, intraocular pressure, and incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Other outcomes are: vision and glaucoma-specific patient-reported outcomes, visual acuity, visual field, angle closure, number of medications, additional surgery (e.g., trabeculectomy), costs to the health services and patients, and adverse events.A single main analysis will be done at the end of the trial, after three years of follow-up. The analysis will be based on all participants as randomized (intention to treat). 400 participants (200 in each group) will be recruited, to have 90% power at 5% significance level to detect a difference in EQ-5D score between the two groups of 0·05, and a mean difference in intraocular pressure of 1·75 mm Hg.

This study is intended to compare the prediction error and the accuracy of predictability of intraocular lens power calculation in pediatric patients at 3 month post cataract surgery with primary implantation of an intraocular lens using SRK II versus Pediatric IOL Calculator for pediatric intraocular lens calculation. Pediatric IOL Calculator is a modification of SRK II using Holladay algorithm. This program attempts to predict the refraction of a pseudophakic child as he grows, using a Holladay algorithm model. This model is based on refraction measurements of pediatric aphakic eyes. Pediatric IOL Calculator uses computer software for intraocular lens calculation.\nThis comparative study consists of 31 eyes (24 patients) that successfully underwent cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantations. All patients were 12 years old and below (range: 4 months to 12 years old). Patients were randomized into 2 groups; SRK II group and Pediatric IOL Calculator group using envelope technique sampling procedure. Intraocular lens power calculations were made using either SRK II or Pediatric IOL Calculator for pediatric intraocular lens calculation based on the printed technique selected for every patient. Thirteen patients were assigned for SRK II group and another 11 patients for Pediatric IOL Calculator group. For SRK II group, the predicted postoperative refraction is based on the patient's axial length and is aimed for emmetropic at the time of surgery. However for Pediatric IOL Calculator group, the predicted postoperative refraction is aimed for emmetropic spherical equivalent at age 2 years old. The postoperative refractive outcome was taken as the spherical equivalent of the refraction at 3 month postoperative follow-up. The data were analysed to compare the mean prediction error and the accuracy of predictability of intraocular lens power calculation between SRK II and Pediatric IOL Calculator.\nThere were 16 eyes in SRK II group and 15 eyes in Pediatric IOL Calculator group. The mean prediction error in the SRK II group was 1.03 D (SD, 0.69 D) while in Pediatric IOL Calculator group was 1.14 D (SD, 1.19 D).

TEM confirmed the presence of lesions inside the optic in all the explanted IOLs and revealed 3 patterns of deep deposits: a) diffuse, thick, granular, electron-dense ones; b) small, thin, lattice-like ones, with prominent electron-lucent areas; and c) elongated electron-dense formations surrounded by electron-lucent halos.

A sutureless iris-fixed ciliary sulcus implantation of a posterior chamber IOL (Binder-IOL, Fa.

These anchors are inserted from behind the iris into peripheral iridotomies performed preoperatively with a YAG-laser or intraoperatively with a vitrectomy cutter. The long, C-shaped haptics are thus secured in the ciliary sulcus.\nAfter slight modification of the technique, the implantation can be performed securely and reproducibly. In the 22 implantations performed to date, the IOL was well centered and stable, even in cases with only residual iris stroma. If the iridotomies are been performed too centrally, an ovalisation of the pupil may occur. No further side effects have been observed.\nThe technique of sutureless sulcus fixation presented here leads to less complications than scleral suture fixation.

{"id": 642, "text": "After the implantation of toric intraocular lenses (tIOLs) significant postoperative tIOL rotation angles were measured occasionally. We investigated the rotational stability of eyes during standardized photography and recommend two methods for an enhanced evaluation of tIOL rotation.\n1. The cyclorotation of the eye was investigated using standard fundus photography. A sequence of two fundus photographic slides was taken in 550 phakic eyes of 275 consecutive patients with a time interval of at least 6 months. With characteristic markers on the fundus photograph, the axial orientation of the eyes was defined and the cyclorotation between the two slides of each eye was measured. 2. Using bifocal photography (HRA II - Heidelberg Retina Angiograph), a sequence of anterior segment and fundus images was taken considering stable head position in 19 pairs of photographs of eyes with implanted tIOLs. The angle between reference fundus axis and tIOL axis was measured at both time stages (mean: after 3 months). The difference of the angle between bifocal-image samples was defined as the real tIOL rotation angle. 3. Ten pairs of anterior segment photographs of eyes with a tIOL were investigated using the Axenfeld loop analysis. In each photograph, the angle between the axis connecting two Axenfeld loops and the tIOL axis was measured. The difference of two angles of two photographs was defined as the rotational tIOL angle.\n1. The mean absolute eye's rotation angle was 2.3 +/- 1.7 degrees (range: 0 to 11.5 degrees) in all 550 eyes. Only 9.1 % of the eyes did not rotate. In 57.3 % of the eyes a rotation of less than 3 degrees and in 33.6 % of more than or equal to 3 degrees was detected. The eye's cyclorotation correlated (p < 0.04) with an age older than 39 years and higher astigmatism (> 1.5 D). Because of the significant amount of spontaneous globe rotation we developed the following enhanced methods to minimize measurement errors of tIOL rotation: 2. Bifocal photography: comparing the 19 HRA anterior segment images, the amount of mean tIOL rotation was 5.4 +/- 4.8 degrees (range: 0 - 20.0 degrees). Using the bifocal photography, the mean tIOL rotation was 1.9 +/- 1.3 degrees (range: 0 - 5.0 degrees). The overestimated rotation of the tIOL (only anterior segment tIOL comparison) correlated with higher amounts of the eye's cyclorotation (r = 0.94; p = 0.01) and higher corneal astigmatism (r = 0.54; p = 0.05). 3. The simultaneous analysis of Axenfeld loops revealed significantly smaller amounts of tIOL rotation (2.3 +/- 2.5 degrees range: 0 - 7.0 degrees ) in 10 pairs of anterior segment photographs in contrast to the single analysis of tIOL axis (5.5 +/- 4.8 degrees range: 1 - 13.0 degrees p = 0.09). A reduction of up to 18.0 degrees tIOL rotation measurement failure was possible in single cases by applying the bifocal photography or simultaneous Axenfeld loop analysis.\nHead inclination, head rotation, and incyclo- or excyclorotation of the eye may have a significant impact on the tIOL axis evaluation. Besides the bifocal photography the simultaneous Axenfeld loop analysis could be a promising alternative to the conventional axis evaluation of tIOLs.", "label": [[154, 174, "OUTCOME"], [428, 443, "SAMPLE_SIZE"], [447, 450, "SAMPLE_SIZE"], [573, 590, "OUTCOME"], [1412, 1427, "OUTCOME"], [2061, 2074, "OUTCOME"], [2166, 2179, "OUTCOME"], [2234, 2256, "OUTCOME"], [2399, 2418, "OUTCOME"], [2911, 2927, "OUTCOME"], [2929, 2942, "OUTCOME"]]}

All patients had a standard preoperative workup with subsequent cataract extraction and IOL implantation according to conventional biometric measurements and IOL calculations. Intraoperative autorefractive retinoscopy was used to obtain aphakic autorefraction and to measure the aphakic spherical equivalent before lens implantation. A linear regression analysis was used to correlate the aphakic spherical equivalent to the final adjusted emmetropic IOL power to empirically derive a refractive formula for IOL calculation (optical refractive biometry method). A second validation series of 16 eyes was used in a head-to-head comparison between the optical refractive biometry and the conventional IOL formulas. A subset of 6 eyes from the validation series were post-refractive cases having subsequent cataract surgery.\nIntraoperative retinoscopic autorefraction was successfully obtained in all 22 patients in the pilot group and all 16 patients in the validation group. The spherical equivalent of the aphakic autorefraction correlated linearly with the final adjusted emmetropic IOL power (P<.0001, with adjusted r(2)=.9985). The relationship was sustained over an axial length range of 21.43 to 25.25 mm and an IOL power range of 12.0 to 25.5 diopters (D). In a subsequent validation series of 10 standard and 6 post-laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) cataract cases, the optical refractive biometry method proved to be a better predictive model for IOL estimation than conventional formulas; 83% of the LASIK eyes and 100% of the normal eyes were within +/-1.0 D of the final IOL power when aphakic autorefraction was used, compared with 67% of LASIK eyes and 100% of the normal eyes, using the conventional methodology.\nA new model for IOL power calculation was derived based on an optical refractive methodology that breaks away from the conventional art introduced by Fyodorov in the 1960s.

The patients were randomized to implantation with either a silicone intraocular lens (IOL) (SI40NB, Allergan) or an AcrySof IOL (MA60BM, Alcon). Three years after surgery, the rate of PCO was analysed using the evaluation of posterior capsule opacification computer software (EPCO).

A retrospective review of a subgroup of 140 consecutive cases was done to categorize postoperative optic clarity.\nOverall, the IOLs were easy to implant with no haptic or optic damage using a forceps or the Monarch injector. Subgroup studies confirmed good performance in the following parameters: There were no cases of incision incompetence evidenced by an abnormally low postoperative IOP. The lowest postoperative IOP was 6 mm Hg, with the overall mean IOP increasing to 29 mm Hg from the 17 mm Hg measured a mean of 102 minutes after surgery. The manufacturer's published A-constant was almost identical to that obtained in review (118.4 versus 118.38 for the SA30AL and 118.35 for the SA60AT).

The presence or absence of CSME at the time of surgery was the most significant determinant of 1-year logMAR VA in regression models for both extracapsular (P = 0.0004, R2 = 0.45) and phacoemulsification groups (P < 0.00005, R2 = 0.46).\nPhacoemulsification is associated with better postoperative VA, less postoperative inflammation, and less need for capsulotomy than extracapsular cataract surgery in patients with diabetes. However, with both techniques, the principal determinant of postoperative VA appears to be the presence or absence of CSME at the time of surgery. Early intervention, reducing the risk that unrecognized CSME is present at the time of surgery, may be more critical to outcome than choice of surgical technique.", "label": [[154, 196, "STUDY_DESIGN"], [197, 215, "SAMPLE_SIZE"], [794, 816, "OUTCOME"], [834, 839, "ADVERSE_EVENT"], [899, 918, "ADVERSE_EVENT"], [934, 959, "ADVERSE_EVENT"], [1172, 1176, "ADVERSE_EVENT"], [1526, 1530, "OUTCOME"], [2000, 2002, "OUTCOME"], [2044, 2048, "OUTCOME"]]}

A clear corneal incision measuring 2.8 mm, capsulorrhexis, hydrodissection and hydrodelineation of the nucleus and the epinucleus were performed first. A chopping instrument was then introduced by a second port to facilitate the laser procedure. Finally, the incision was enlarged to introduce the foldable IOL in the bag without suture. Eight eyes of six patients with a soft cataract were operated by Nd:YAG Laser, and followed for 6 to 10 months.

The IOLP calculations were done using two different formulas (SRK/T and HAIGIS).\nKeratometric power (K) and topographic simulated keratometric power (TOPO) as measured (Kmeas, TOPOmeas) and as calculated according to the change of power of the anterior corneal surface or according to the spherical equivalent change after PRK (Kcalc, TOPOcalc), IOLP for emmetropia, and postoperative ametropia for calculated corneal powers were assessed in a model.\nAfter PRK, mean Kmeas and TOPOmeas were significantly greater (0.4-1.4 D, maximum 3.3 D) than mean KRcalc and TOPOcalc (P < 0.0001). On average, the relative flattening of the cornea after PRK was underestimated by 14% to 30% (maximum, 83%) depending on the method of calculation. The mean theoretical IOLP after PRK ranged from + 17.4 D (SRK/T, TOPOmeas) to +20.9 D (HAIGIS, Kcalc) depending on the calculation method for corneal power and IOLP calculation formula used. For both formulas, IOLP values using keratometric readings were significantly higher (>1 D) than IOLP values using topographic readings (P < 0.0001). The theoretically induced mean refractive error after cataract surgery ranged from +0.4 to +1.4 (maximum, +3.1) D. Corneal power overestimation and IOLP underestimation correlated significantly with the spherical equivalent change after PRK (P = 0.001) and the intended ablation depth during PRK (P = 0.004).\nTo avoid underestimation of IOLP and hyperopia after cataract surgery following PRK, measured corneal power values must be corrected. The calculation method using spherical equivalent change of refraction at the corneal plane seems to be the most appropriate method. In comparison with this method, direct power measurements underestimate corneal flattening after PRK by 24% on average. Use of conventional topography analysis seems to increase the risk of error.

Peribulbar blocks were achieved with plain bupivacaine 0.5% (5.5 mL), lidocaine 2% (5.5 mL), and hyaluronidase (100 IU = 2 mL) (n = 10) ir sterile water (2 mL) (n = 11). Plasma bupivacaine and lidocaine concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography at regular intervals from the end of the local anesthetic injection until the 360th minute. Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to reach Cmax (Tmax) were obtained for all the patients except one who needed a supplementary injection and was excluded from the study. The time to onset and duration of the analgesia and akinesia were monitored at the times of sampling. Motor blockade was incomplete in two patients in each group without affecting surgery. The Tmax and absorption half-life (t1/2a) of lidocaine and bupivacaine were not different within each group (P > 0.05). The Tmax of lidocaine was shorter in the presence of hyaluronidase (17.1 +/- 2.6 min vs 32.7 +/- 6.0 min) as well as the Tmax of bupivacaine (16.8 +/- 3.0 min vs 26.5 +/- 4.4 min). The Cmax of lidocaine and bupivacaine were not modified by the addition of hyaluronidase. The clearance, terminal half-life, and volume of distribution were not different between groups. The absorption of lidocaine and bupivacaine from the peribulbar space are hastened by the addition of hyaluronidase. The Tmax of lidocaine is not different from that of bupivacaine within each group suggesting that the absorption of local anesthetics is minimally influenced by the liposolubility of the drugs. Moreover, hyaluronidase influences the absorption kinetics of both lidocaine and bupivacaine in the same manner.", "label": [[293, 312, "SAMPLE_SIZE"], [389, 417, "STUDY_DESIGN"], [1019, 1027, "ADVERSE_EVENT"], [1069, 1083, "ADVERSE_EVENT"], [1169, 1197, "OUTCOME"], [1562, 1575, "OUTCOME"]]}

The rate of postoperative fibrin exsudation is lower under treatment with topical indomethacin or flurbiprofen compared to diclofenac.

Clinical estimation of gas in the pupil is limited by its size. Accuracy of pupil measurements will be tested and compared with experimental results obtained by estimating the level of gas meniscus at the retina.\nTen cadaver eyes (5 phakic, 4 aphakic, 1 pseudophakic) were fixed in a plastic mold, vitrectomized and injected with multiple randomized volumes of air.

Survival analyses for IOP were performed for the cases and controls. We reviewed the charts of 40 consecutive patients who underwent combined temporal corneal phacoemulsification and superior trabeculectomy with low dose 5-FU to determine the effect on IOP, visual acuity, and requirement for glaucoma medications. For controls, we chose 40 eyes matched with respect to age, race, preoperative medications, and preoperative IOP who had trabeculectomy alone with low dose 5-FU. In both groups, trabeculectomy was performed with the same technique, was located superiorly, and employed a limbus-based conjunctival flap. In the combined surgery group, temporal corneal phacoemulsification immediately preceded trabeculectomy and employed a 3.5-mm incision and a one-piece silicone intraocular lens. All patients received 3 or 4 subconjunctival 5-FU injections of 5 mg each over the first 11 postoperative days. Patients were followed up for at least 1 year. Success of trabeculectomy was defined as an IOP less than 22 mmHg and 20% or more reduction from the preoperative level on 2 consecutive follow-up visits, regardless of the use of antiglaucoma medications.\nThe mean postoperative intraocular pressure was higher in the combined surgery group than in the control group at each follow-up interval (P < 0.05). The mean (+/- SD) IOP reduction was 6.8 (+/- 5.5) mmHg in the combined surgery group, and 10.3 (+/- 7.6) mmHg in the trabeculectomy group at 1 year. The reduction in the number of antiglaucoma medications was 1.6 (+/- 0.9) in the combined surgery group and 2.0 (+/- 1.0) in the control group at 1 year. In the combined surgery group, the mean visual acuity beyond the first postoperative month was significantly better than at baseline (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the cumulative success rate at 2 years was 62% in the combined surgery group and 86% in the trabeculectomy group. The time to failure was significantly shorter (P = 0.04) in the combined surgery group.\nCombined surgery for cataract and glaucoma is associated with less long-term IOP reduction compared with trabeculectomy alone, despite identical trabeculectomy techniques in both groups.

Moreover, the influence of ultrasound time and power on postoperative endothelial cell density was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Sixty-two patients (age 71 +/- 7.7 years) without corneal pathology were operated by phacoemulsification (Storz, Premiere) with a temporal, self-sealing, two-step clear-corneal incision followed by posterior chamber IOL implantation under viscoelastic (1% sodium hyal-uronate). Thirty-one one-piece plate-haptic foldable silicone IOLs (Chiron C10; Staar Surgical AA-4203) were implanted by an injector through a 3.5 mm incision (group A). The other 31 PMMA IOLs (Pharmacia 809P) were implanted through a 5 mm incision (group B). One surgeon performed all operations with the same technique (bimanual phacoemulsification in the capsular bag). Sutureless wound closure was performed in group A, while the wounds in patients of group B were closed with a single radial stitch. The central endothelial cell counts were recorded preoperatively, on days 2-5 and 6 months postoperatively using contact specular microscopy. RESULTS. The collective data revealed a cell loss of 7.9% (+/- 4.1 SD) on days 2-5 postoperatively and 6.7% (+/- 2.9) after 6 months. A direct linear relationship was found to exist between ultrasound time (UT) and ECL. In group A (7 patients) the ECL slightly increased from 3.5% in the first week postoperatively to 3.8% after 6 months, operated under UT < or = 1 min 30 sec. The ECL decreased from 8.2% to 6.4% after 6 months in group A (19 patients), operated under UT of 1 min 30 sec, and from 10.8% to 8.9% under UT of 2 min 31 sec-3 min 30 sec (5 patients). The ECL in group B decreased from 6.3% in the first postoperative week to 5.4% 6 months postoperatively, operated under UT < or = 1 min 30 sec (10 patients), from 8.1% to 7%, operated under UT of 1 min 31 sec-2 min 30 sec (14 patients), and from 11.2% to 10.4% under UT of 2 min 31 sec-3 min 30 sec (7 patients). CONCLUSION. Endothelial cell loss of 6.7% after phacoemulsification through a temporal clear-corneal incision compares favorably with other series in which cell loss was determined following cataract surgery with or without IOL implantation.

Calculation reduced the incidence of postoperative refractive error greater than the +/- 2 D range from 20 per cent to 1 per cent virtually eliminating significant postoperative refractive error. Consideration of the preoperative refractions and the calculated IOL powers showed that there is no constant or reliable relationship. Twenty nine 'emmetropic' eyes were shown not to be 'normal' eyes but eyes with a wide range of axial lengths whose different optical components summated to give emmetropia. In the selection of IOL power, reference must be made to biometric data to allow for these optical components and for this reason IOL power cannot be determined from the preoperative refraction of the eye. The case for control of postoperative refraction by calculation of IOL power is a strong one and there appears little justification for the use of standard power IOLs with unpredictable refraction results.", "label": [[33, 56, "DEVICE"], [548, 558, "OUTCOME"], [618, 647, "SAMPLE_SIZE"], [921, 930, "OUTCOME"], [1064, 1073, "OUTCOME"]]}
