Children with gross subluxated lenses and aphakia following intracapsular cataract extraction with inadequate posterior capsular support underwent intrascleral fixation of a standard three-piece posterior chamber IOL without sutures, flaps, or glue. A retrospective study of 15 eyes of 11 patients with a mean follow-up period of 6 months was performed. The main outcome measures were improvement in visual acuity (best corrected [BCVA] and uncorrected [UCVA]) and early and late postoperative complications.
Preoperative to postoperative mean UCVA changed from 1.34 ± 0.35 to 0.36 ± 0.18 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), respectively (P < .001). Preoperative to postoperative mean BCVA changed from 0.69 ± 0.37 to 0.19 ± 0.19 logMAR, respectively (P < .001). Two patients showed early postoperative complications within 1 week.

Eye Department, Southampton University Hospital, United Kingdom.
Randomized masked single-center clinical trial.
Patients with bilateral cataract who were older than 50 years with a biometry-predicted IOL power between 10.0 diopters (D) and 30.0 D were recruited. Outcome measures included corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) using a high-contrast logMAR chart, contrast sensitivity measured with the Pelli-Robson chart, range of accommodation using the Royal Air Force (RAF) rule, pseudoaccommodation and mesopic and scotopic pupil diameters measured with a power refractor, and patient satisfaction evaluated using a previously validated questionnaire 3 months after second-eye surgery.
The difference in the mean value between the 2 IOLs (40 patients) was 0.015 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0009 to 0.070) for CDVA in favor of the spherical IOL, 0.02 (95% CI, -0.0534 to 0.0159) for contrast sensitivity, and 0.05 (95% CI, -1.90 to +2.90) for range of accommodation. Questionnaire results showed no difference in dysphotopsia or patient satisfaction between the 2 IOLs.
Although there were no statistically significant differences in contrast sensitivity, range of accommodation, dysphotopsia, or subjective patient satisfaction or preference between the 2 IOLs, the difference in CDVA was statistically significant, but not clinically important (relative difference 1.5%), in favor of the spherical IOL.

In groups I, II, III and IV the drug was instilled 5-6, 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively, before surgery, into the eye to be operated, and in group V 4 h before surgery into the contralateral eye. Aqueous humour samples were aspirated at the beginning of the operation. Aqueous humour concentrations of betaxolol were analyzed using a radioreceptor assay, and the ex-vivo-beta 1- and beta 2-receptor occupancies of betaxolol were calculated. The highest concentration of betaxolol in aqueous humour was found 5-6 hours after instillation of the drug. Topical betaxolol was found to stay in aqueous humour for 48 h, a much longer time than the recommended interval of dosage. Betaxolol beta 1-receptor occupancy was 99-95% during the study, but also beta 2-receptor occupancy was significant (52%) 24 h after instillation of the drug.

Only in near (33 cm), the EDOF group had significantly worse binocular visual acuity than did the Trifocal group (p = 0.002). Regarding to defocus curve, the Trifocal group had better defocus curves at near distances (- 2.0 to - 3.5 D; p = 0.001 vs. EDOF) than did the other two groups. In contrast sensitivity test, the EDOF group had relatively lower value than did the other two groups. In reading speed, only at 0.3 logMAR (6.5-point font), Mix-and-Match group had a significantly higher reading speed than did the other two groups (p =  < 0.001 vs. EDOF, p = 0.007 vs. Trifocal). also Mix-and-Match group showed significantly fewer visual artifacts.

Two hundred and eighty-eight patients with bilateral surgery for senile cataract operated in German university clinics, eye hospitals, and private ophthalmic surgical centers (Aachen, Ahaus, Bad Hersfeld, Frankfurt/Main, Jena, Rosenheim, and Sulzbach/Saar).
At each center, a highly refractive index silicone IOL with a sharp optic edge (CeeOn) was intraindividually compared either with a high-refractive index silicone IOL with a round optic edge (PhacoFlex) in 108 patients or with an acrylic IOL with a sharp optic edge (AcrySof) in 139 patients. All patients received standard phacoemulsification with IOL implantation in the bag in both eyes from the same surgeon. A morphological evaluation of PCO was performed by the Evaluation of the Posterior Capsule Opacification (EPCO) system 1 to 2 weeks and 11 to 14 and 35 to 37 months after surgery.

Phenomenology and mechanism of action].,[],Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft,"The aim of this study was to analyze quantitatively the phenomenology and mechanisms of motor blockade induced by retrobulbar anesthesia (RETRO).
Prior to cataract surgery, 34 patients received RETRO using the intraconal technique of Atkinson. Four milliliters of mepivacaine 2% (Scandicain), prilocaine 2% (Xylonest) or lidocaine 2% (Xylocain) were injected in randomized order. Prior to injection, as well as 5, 30, 90, 120, 180, 300 and 420 min after injection, the following variables were determined: deviation of the eye from the primary position (Krimsky test), horizontal and vertical ocular motility (Kestenbaum limbustest), and rotatory ocular motility (presence of in- or excycloductions).
The directions in which the eye deviated after RETRO were abduction and depression. The maximum deviations amounted to 7-8 degrees abduction and 3-4.5 degrees depression and were observed 30 min after injection. Horizontal and vertical ocular motility was nearly completely and symmetrically reduced 30 min after RETRO. There were no significant differences between the three local anesthetics used.
The present findings may be interpreted as temporary palsy of N.III and N.VI during RETRO (symmetrical blockade of horizontal and vertical recti eye muscles) with unaffected function of N.IV and superior oblique muscle (maintained incycloduction ability; hypotropia and exotropia). An additional possible mechanism to account for the observed downward deviation is that the eye assumes its physiological divergent resting position during RETRO.",,,The directions in which the eye deviated after RETRO were abduction and depression.

Best corrected contrast acuity was measured using the Regan Charts (96%, 50%, 25%, 11%) at four pupil sizes (2.0, 2.5, 3.5, 6.0 mm) in three groups (Group 1: corneal astigmatism 0-0.50 D [n = 11]; Group 2: 0.75-1.50 D [n = 11]; Group 3: 1.75-2.50 D [n = 4]). In monofocal eyes, BCCA between these astigmatic groups did not differ significantly at any contrast step or at any pupil size tested. However, BCCA decreased slightly with increasing pupil size in each group, and differences between 2.00 mm and 6.0 mm pupils were significant at each contrast level. In all bifocal groups, BCCA decreased significantly with increasing pupil size and also decreased with increasing corneal astigmatism; differences were significant at most pupil sizes and contrasts tested. In Group 1, BCCA was lower in eyes with bifocal IOLs than in eyes with monofocal IOLs at 25% and 11% contrast with a 2.5, 3.5, and 6.0 mm pupil; with a 2.0 mm pupil it did not differ significantly. In Groups 2 and 3, BCCA in eyes with bifocal IOLs was lower at all contrast steps and all pupil sizes tested.

537,540,18218068,Patient-reported benefit of ReSTOR multi-focal intraocular lenses after cataract surgery: results of principal component analysis on clinical trial data.,[],Health and quality of life outcomes,"Restoration of functional distance and near vision independently of additional correction remains a goal for cataract surgery. ReSTOR, a new multi-focal intraocular lens (IOL) addresses this issue with an improvement in both distance and near vision, often without need for glasses. This analysis attempted to discuss the patient-reported benefit of ReSTOR using a full but organised representation of data.
Two non-randomised, open-label clinical trials conducted in Europe and the United-States were conducted to compare the efficacy of ReSTOR to AcrySof mono-focal IOLs. A total of 710 patients in need of bilateral cataract extraction were included in the pooled study. The TyPE, a patient questionnaire, was fully completed by 672 of them before and after each eye surgery. The TyPE, composed of 67 items measuring overall visual functioning in both conditions (with and without wearing glasses), evaluates limitations, troubles and satisfaction in distance and near vision. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the TyPE questionnaire was performed on pooled data from baseline and post-surgery observations in order to fully represent the change in the TyPE data over time. ReSTOR and mono-focal groups were used as illustrative variables. The coordinates of the first 2 factors were compared between visits and between IOLs (ReSTOR vs. mono-focal), using paired t-tests and t-tests, respectively.
The first factor of the PCA explained 55% of the variance and represented 'visual functioning and patient satisfaction'. The second factor explained 6% of the variance and was interpreted as 'independence from glasses'. An overall difference in factorial coordinates in both factors was seen between baseline and the first eye surgery, and between the first and the second eye surgery. No difference between ReSTOR and mono-focal IOL groups was observed at baseline. After surgery, ReSTOR treated-patients had higher coordinates on both ""visual functioning and satisfaction"" and ""independence from glasses"" factors. Findings observed on the factorial plan were supported by statistical comparisons of factorial coordinates.
Both mono-focal and ReSTOR-implanted patients improved their visual functioning after bilateral cataract surgery. Moreover, ReSTOR patients reported an additional benefit in independence from glasses as well as in visual functioning and patient satisfaction.","Both mono-focal and ReSTOR-implanted patients improved their visual functioning after bilateral cataract surgery.

Cincinnati Eye Institute and Ambulatory Surgical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.
Forty-one eyes of 40 patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. In Group A, standard capsular bag expansion was performed with Healon5 before implantation of an acrylic posterior chamber (PC) IOL. In Group B, Healon5 was placed in the anterior chamber followed by balanced salt solution expansion of the capsular bag before acrylic PC IOL implantation. In all patients, complete OVD removal was attempted with the automated aspiration tip anterior to the optic (rock 'n roll technique). The number of patients in each group who required placement of the aspiration tip posterior to the optic for complete removal was compared.

In an open prospective randomized multicenter study, each center intraindividually compared a high-refractive-index, sharp-edged optic silicone IOL (CeeOn Edge 911A, Pharmacia) with a high-refractive-index, round-edged optic silicone IOL (PhacoFlex SI-40NB, Allergan) or a sharp-edged optic acrylic IOL (AcrySof MA60BM, Alcon). Of 288 randomized patients, 247 had standard phacoemulsification with in-the-bag IOL implantation in both eyes by the same surgeon. One eye of each patient received a CeeOn Edge IOL and the fellow eye, an AcrySof or PhacoFlex IOL. A morphologic evaluation of PCO was performed using the Evaluation of Posterior Capsule Opacification (EPCO) system 1 to 2 weeks and 11 to 14 months after surgery. The digital pictures were evaluated by an independent investigator who was blind to the type of IOL. Intraindividual differences in EPCO scores were statistically evaluated by a 1-sided binomial test at an alpha-level of 5%.
One year after surgery, 127 patients with the AcrySof IOL and 102 patients with the PhacoFlex IOL in the control eye were reexamined. Functional results, safety, and handling were not significantly different between the 3 IOLs. All reexamined eyes had a very low PCO grade.

In this randomized patient- and examiner-masked study, 37 patients (74 eyes) with age-related cataract had bilateral small-incision cataract surgery with PCCC. Randomly, 1 eye received a hydrogel IOL and the contralateral eye, a silicone IOL. Both IOLs had open-loop haptics and a round-edged optic. Standardized digital retroillumination photographs were taken 1 day and 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery to evaluate development of after-cataract on the anterior and posterior capsules by subjective grading. Opacification of the PCCC area was also objectively evaluated using new software.
Twenty-nine patients (58 eyes) completed the 2-year follow-up. Partial closure with ongrowth at the edge of the PCCC was found in 55% in the hydrogel group and 28% in the silicone group. Total closure of the PCCC was observed in 3 eyes, 2 in the hydrogel group and 1 in the silicone group.
Ongrowth onto the PCCC area was dependent on IOL material. Because of less ongrowth and more fibrotic after-cataract with silicone IOLs, the efficacy of the PCCC was higher in this group.","Ongrowth onto the PCCC area was dependent on IOL material.

A comparison between acetylcholine and carbachol.,[],Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,"Ninety patients who had phacoemulsification and implantation of a flexible polyHEMA intraocular lens (IOGEL 1103) were assigned to three groups. After evacuation of sodium hyaluronate retrolentally from the capsular bag, 0.5 ml of 1% acetylcholine chloride, 0.01% carbachol, or balanced salt solution was instilled into the anterior chamber following wound closure. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured the day before, and six hours, 18 hours, and one week postoperatively. No topical or systemic antiglaucomatous drug was given during the study period. Preoperatively and one week postoperatively there was no significant difference between the three groups (P greater than .01). At six hours postoperatively the mean IOP decreased in the carbachol group (-2.8 mm Hg) and increased in the acetylcholine and control groups (+0.6 mm Hg and +/- 4.7 mm Hg) when compared with baseline pressures. At 18 hours the mean change from baseline was -3.0 mm Hg in the carbachol group, +0.8 mm Hg in the acetylcholine group, and +2.3 mm Hg in the control group. At six hours IOP exceeding 22 mm Hg was observed in ten of the control patients (30%) receiving balanced salt solution intracamerally and four of the acetylcholine patients (13.3%) but none of the carbachol patients.

Visual acuity, pupil size, and astigmatism were determined. Contrast acuity was measured in a randomized subgroup of best-case patients (n = 60; Regan charts); subjective assessment of vision was compared in 41 best cases with a monofocal fellow eye. Two hundred twenty-seven best-case patients were available for four to six months follow-up, and 145 for seven to eleven months. Best corrected distance acuity was 20/40 or better in 96% and 98%, respectively. Near acuity was 20/30 or better in 93% and 92% with near add, in 64% and 69% uncorrected, and in 79% and 78% with distance correction, respectively. Distance and near acuity decreased with increasing astigmatism and increasing age. Contrast acuity at distance focus was lower than for monofocal IOLs (11% contrast); values at near focus were considerably lower at all contrast steps tested. Of the patients with a monofocal fellow eye, 96% rated their distance vision with glasses in the monofocal eye as good, compared with 78% in the bifocal eye. The True Vista IOL favors distance vision while near acuity is still sufficient. As high image contrast at distance is usually more important than at near, this might be a good compromise.

The authors conducted a prospective study of 253 consecutive eyes that underwent cataract extraction with or without lens implantation by one surgeon from 1976 to 1982. Three types of lens implant were used during this period. The protocol included ophthalmic examinations and specular microscopy on all eyes preoperatively, and 2 months and 1, 3, 5, and 10 years postoperatively.
The 10-year analysis was conducted on 67 (26%) of the 253 total eyes. The remaining patients died (86 eyes [34%]), were unable to return 10 years later (93 eyes [37%]), or had secondary implants (5 eyes [2%]) or penetrating keratoplasty (2 eyes [1%]). There were no statistically significant differences among the median 10-year endothelial cell losses of 36% in 17 control cataract extractions without lens implantation (15 extracapsular and 2 intracapsular), 40% in 15 medallion iris suture implants, 32% in 28 transiridectomy clip implants, and 32% in 7 posterior chamber implants. The median exponential rate of chronic cell loss from 1 to 10 years after surgery was 2.5% per year, which did not differ significantly among the three implant groups or between the implants (2.4% per year) and controls (2.7% per year). The chronic cell loss rate was significantly higher (7.2% per year) in six eyes with cornea guttata, which was the only preoperative endothelial morphologic feature that was significantly associated with the chronic cell loss rate.
Ten years after cataract extraction, eyes continued to lose endothelial cells from the central cornea at a rate of 2.5% per year, 2.5 to 8.0 times the rate in healthy unoperated eyes. The rate was not affected significantly by the presence of the three types of lens implants that the authors used.

However, previous studies from our clinic have shown no significant MVA difference between multi- and monofocal IOLs. In the present study (with the patients matched exactly for age), this topic was reevaluated.
We investigated three groups, each consisting of 28 persons, 51 to 60 years of age. Group I consisted of healthy phakic volunteers, group II of patients 3 months after cataract extraction and implantation of a monofocal posterior chamber IOL (Pharmacia 720A) and group III of patients 3 months after implantation of a diffractive multifocal posterior chamber IOL with biconvex optic configuration (3M 825X). The MVA was examined using the ""Ocutrast,"" described by Nowak. The Ocutrast, a modification of the Mesoptometer II, provides a field luminance of 1 cd/m2 and a contrast of 1:23 between test optotype and background; the intensity of illumination under glare conditions amounts to 0.35 lx at the level of the pupil.
The MVA without glare amounted to 0.50 +/- 0.12 (group I, healthy phakic eyes), 0.45 +/- 0.15 (group II, monofocal IOLs) and 0.32 +/- 0.11 (group III, multifocal IOLs). The MVA with glare amounted to 0.47 +/- 0.08 (group I), 0.35 +/- 0.12 (group II) and 0.24 +/- 0.10 (group III). Both for the MVA with and without glare there was a significant group difference (P < 0.05; two-factor analysis of covariance with repeated measurements).
After implantation of diffractive multifocal IOLs of the presently used type (3M 825X), the mesopic vision--both with and without glare--is even more reduced than after monofocal IOL implantation.

A British teaching hospital eye department.
Ninety eyes were prospectively randomized to receive a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), silicone, or AcrySof IOL. All lenses had 6.0 mm optics and PMMA haptics. A standardized surgical protocol was performed by a single surgeon using an extracapsular technique with capsulorhexis. Patients having surgical complications were excluded and all patients had standardized medication and follow-up. Posterior capsule opacification was assessed by a digital retroillumination camera using a dedicated software program based on the analysis of texture in the image and calculated as the percentage area of opacified capsule. Data were analyzed 2 years postoperatively.
There was a significant difference in percentage of PCO at 2 years among the three lens types (P < .0001). The AcrySof lenses were associated with less PCO (median 11.75%) than PMMA (43.65%) and silicone (33.50%) lenses (P < .001 and P = .025, respectively).

212,212,26233628,The Effect of Cataract Surgery on Circadian Photoentrainment: A Randomized Trial of Blue-Blocking versus Neutral Intraocular Lenses.,[],Ophthalmology,"Cataract decreases blue light transmission. Because of the selective blue light sensitivity of the retinal ganglion cells governing circadian photoentrainment, cataract may interfere with normal sleep-wake regulation and cause sleep disturbances. The purpose was to investigate the effect of cataract surgery on circadian photoentrainment and to determine any difference between blue-blocking and neutral intraocular lenses (IOLs).
The study was a single-center, investigator-driven, double-masked, block-randomized clinical trial.
One eye in 76 patients with bilateral age-related cataract eligible for cataract surgery was included.
Intervention was cataract surgery by phacoemulsification. Patients were randomized to receive a blue-blocking or neutral IOL.
Primary outcome was activation of intrinsic photosensitive ganglion cells using post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) to blue light from 10 to 30 seconds after light exposure as a surrogate measure. Secondary outcomes were circadian rhythm analysis using actigraphy and 24-hour salivary melatonin measurements. Finally, objective and subjective sleep quality were determined by actigraphy and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
The blue light PIPR increased 2 days (17%) and 3 weeks (24%) after surgery (P < 0.001). The majority of circadian and sleep-specific actigraphy parameters did not change after surgery. A forward shift of the circadian rhythm by 22 minutes (P = 0.004) for actigraphy and a tendency toward an earlier melatonin onset (P = 0.095) were found. Peak salivary melatonin concentration increased after surgery (P = 0.037). No difference was detected between blue-blocking and neutral IOLs, whereas low preoperative blue light transmission was inversely associated with an increase in PIPR (P = 0.021) and sleep efficiency (P = 0.048).
Cataract surgery increases photoreception by the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. Because of inconsistency between the significant findings and the many parameters that were unchanged, we can conclude that cataract surgery does not adversely affect the circadian rhythm or sleep. Longer follow-up time and fellow eye surgery may reveal the significance of the subtle changes observed. We found no difference between blue-blocking and neutral IOLs, and, because of the minor effect of surgery in itself, an effect of IOL type seems highly unlikely.",,,"The blue light PIPR increased 2 days (17%) and 3 weeks (24%) after surgery (P < 0.001).

Clinical trial.
Patients with bilateral cataract received a microincision cataract surgery (MICS) IOL in 1 eye and a small-incision cataract surgery (SICS) IOL in the contralateral eye. Follow-up examinations were performed immediately after surgery and postoperatively at 1 week and 3 and 24 months. Posterior capsule opacification was assessed using retroillumination photography. Anterior chamber depth (ACD) was measured using partial coherence laser interferometry, and IOL tilt and decentration were measured using a Purkinje meter.
Seventy eyes (35 patients) were enrolled. The mean ACD at 3 months was 4.91 mm ± 0.26 (SD) in the MICS group and 4.60 ± 0.23 mm in the SICS group. The anterior IOL shift over the first 3 months was slightly smaller with the MICS IOL (81 μm) than with the SICS IOL (254 μm).

Secondary analysis of patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial.
Details regarding all secondary IOL surgeries conducted in children enrolled in the IATS were compiled. Visual outcomes, refractive outcomes, and adverse events at the age of 10½ years were evaluated. Comparisons were made with eyes that remained aphakic and with eyes randomized to primary IOL placement.
The study included 114 infants, 57 in the aphakic group and 57 in the primary IOL group; 55 of 57 patients randomized to aphakia with contact lens correction were seen for the 10½-year study visit; 24 (44%) of 55 eyes had secondary IOL surgery. Median age at IOL surgery was 5.4 years (range 1.7 to 10.3 years). Mean absolute prediction error was 1.00 ± 0.70 diopters (D). At age 10½ years, the median logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity (VA) was 0.9 (range 0.2 to 1.7), similar to VA in the 31 eyes still aphakic (0.8, range 0.1 to 2.9); the number of eyes with stable or improved VA scores between the 4½-year and 10½-year study visits was also similar (78% secondary IOL eyes; 84% aphakic eyes). For eyes undergoing IOL implantation after the 4½-year study visit (n = 22), the mean refraction at age 10½ years was -3.20 ± 2.70 D (range -9.90 to 1.10 D), compared with -5.50 ± 6.60 D (n = 53, range -26.50 to 3.00 D) in eyes with primary IOL (P = .03).

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether cataract surgery with scleral incision is possible using only topical sponge anesthesia with oxybuprocaine 0.4%. This method was compared with retrobulbar injection.
150 patients (3 groups each consisting 50 eyes) underwent phaco with scleral incision. 1st group: oxybuprocaine sponge anesthesia. 2nd group: oxybuprocaine sponge anesthesia combined with mild systemic analgesia (tramadol p.o.). 3rd group: retrobulbar injection (prilocaine/etidocaine mixture). All patients received medazolam premedication (Dormicum, 3/10 of 1 cc). Pain and discomfort during and after operation were investigated and statistically analyzed.
Neither in group 1, 2 or 3 an additional subconjunctival injection was necessary. Pain or discomfort during operation was felt in 14 percent of the patients anesthetized with the oxybuprocaine sponge but only in 6 percent of the patients additionally premedicated with tramadol (2nd group). Also 6 percent of the patients after retrobulbar injection felt pain during operation. Postoperatively no significant differences between group 1 and 2 were obtained: 6 percent felt pain, 30 percent had a short term foreign body sensation. After retrobulbar injection (group 3) only 10 percent felt postoperative pain or discomfort.
Topically applied oxybuprocaine provides sufficient anesthesia during cataract surgery with scleral incision. A combination with mild systemic analgesia (tramadol) helps to minimize pain and discomfort. Retrobulbur injection yielded only in the postoperative period significantly better analgesia. In the operating room full cooperation of the patient is required.

This prospective, randomized clinical study evaluated 53 eyes with senile cataract. Patients were divided into two groups: high-frequency capsulotomy (n = 27) or CCC (n = 26). The surgical procedure and postoperative therapy were standardized for both groups. The intraoperative course was documented, and postoperative complications were examined by biomicroscopy 3 months postoperatively. Without the pupil dilated, BAB disturbance was evaluated with a laser flare-cell meter at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days postoperatively. The findings were analyzed statistically.
Intraoperatively, the high-frequency capsulotomy group had a significantly higher rate of radial tears in the anterior lens capsule. Postoperatively, this resulted in a higher incidence of postoperative false positioning of the intraocular lens. At no time were the flare-cell meter results between groups statistically significant.
High-frequency capsulotomy resulted in no more trauma than CCC. It can be a good alternative to conventional techniques, particularly in eyes with no red reflex.

Standardized digital slitlamp images of anterior capsule opacification (ACO) and fibrotic posterior capsule opacification (PCO) were taken 1 year postoperatively, and digital retroillumination images were taken at 1 week and 1 year. The intensity of fibrotic PCO was graded subjectively (score 0 to 4), ACO was graded objectively (score 0% to 100%), and the capsulorhexis area (mm(2)) was determined objectively.
One year after surgery, the mean ACO score was 32% in eyes with the sharp-edged acrylic IOL and 29% in eyes with the round-edged acrylic IOL (P<.05).

The mean age was 29.5 (SD 3.4) years, the male/female ratio was 10/8. 13 patients (24 eyes) were myopic (mean myopia -16.17 (4.39) D, range -9 to -24 D), whereas five patients (10 eyes) were hyperopic (mean hyperopia 7.4 (2.01) D, range 5.5-11 D). For each patient, ACD was evaluated comparing an optical system (Orbscan topograph system) with a standard A-scan ultrasound system. To evaluate the reliability of the two methods, the average of three optical and 10 ultrasonic consecutive measurements were considered. Statistical analysis was performed by means linear regression.
The average difference between optical and ultrasound values was 0.17 (0.1) mm (4.68% (2.52%)). There was a constant underestimation of the ACD with the optical system compared with the ultrasound measurement, more evident in the hyperopic eyes (5.20% (1. 95%)) than in myopic ones (4.46% (2.72%)).

This report examines the correlations between the anterior chamber flare and cell reaction and the anterior IOL surface cellular reaction. The findings suggest that the early postoperative blood-aqueous barrier breakdown is primarily caused by surgical trauma; by one month the blood-aqueous barrier function is determined by inflammatory mediators released by small monocyte-derived cells on the IOL surface.

893,901,9754188,Refractive and visual outcome of hyperopic cataract cases operated on before and after implementation of the Holladay II formula.,[],Ophthalmology,"The primary objective was to evaluate the refractive and visual outcomes in a series of hyperopic cataract cases in which the Holladay II intraocular lens (IOL) power formula was used in conjunction with added eye measurements (measured anterior chamber depth [ACD], lens thickness, and corneal diameter) to improve predictability of refractive outcome. In addition, the impact of use of a double (""piggyback"") IOL on refractive outcome was evaluated.
Prospective, nonrandomized comparative clinical trial.
A total of 136 consecutive hyperopic primary cataract-IOL cases operated on at in an outpatient eye surgery center were evaluated. The main inclusion criterion was the requirement of at least 30 D of emmetropia power.
Implantation of a total implanted power calculated using a newly developed (Holladay II) formula, which uses additional eye measurements (measured ACD, lens thickness, corneal diameter) in addition to the axial length and keratometry normally used, was performed. In the first series, IOL powers were chosen using the Lloyd-Gills formula with modifiers; in the second series, powers were chosen using the Holladay II formula option in the Holladay IOL Consultant software. Selection criteria for both series were the same (requiring at least 30 diopters [D] of power for emmetropia). Keratometry and axial length measurements (by immersion) were taken using the same instrumentation and methodology in both series. Predicted postoperative refraction based on the IOL implanted and the method of power calculation used were computed for each case in both groups and compared to the actual achieved refraction.
Main clinical outcome parameters evaluated were the postoperative spherical equivalent (compared with the predicted spherical equivalent) and the best-corrected vision. These outcome parameters were evaluated within each surgical series, in the total group of cases (regardless of power calculation method). Further stratification according to the use of single or double implants also was done.
In the group using an older formula system, mean preoperative spherical equivalent of 4.79 D was reduced to -0.67 D. Similarly, in the Holladay II group, the preoperative mean of 5.60 D was reduced to -0.58 D. However, there were fewer large deviations between predicted and achieved spherical equivalent in the Holladay II group as indicated by a smaller standard deviation of the absolute deviation (0.47 vs. 0.59), and the range of postoperative refractions was smaller with fewer large overcorrections or undercorrections. However, almost 90% of both groups were within a diopter of the predicted refraction. Visual results were comparable in the two groups.
Both IOL calculation systems showed good predictability in these extremely short eyes. The Holladay II formula was simpler because it is incorporated into a user-friendly software package (Holladay IOL Consultant) and required only the input of IOL constants and preoperative measurements with no ""fudge factor"" modifiers. Results within the series using this formula had a tendency toward a smaller standard deviation with fewer outliers.","Both IOL calculation systems showed good predictability in these extremely short eyes.

In this prospective single-surgeon standardized-surgical-procedure fellow-eye comparison, an AcrySof SN60AT or an AF-1 YA-60BB IOL was randomized to the first eye of 36 patients and fellow-eye surgery was performed within 4 to 6 weeks. Follow-up was at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Best distance- corrected logMAR visual acuity was measured at 100% and 9% contrast. Contrast sensitivity was measured using the Functional Acuity Contrast Test (FACT) on the Optec 3500 instrument (Stereo Optical Company, Inc.). Color vision was assessed with the Farnsworth Munsell 100-hue test. After pupil dilation, digital retroillumination photographs were taken and the percentage area of PCO was calculated using POCO software.
Posterior capsule opacification was significantly greater in the AF-1 YA-60BB group than in the AcrySof SN60AT group at all time points (P<.0001), with the difference greatest at 24 months. At 24 months, 100% contrast visual acuity was significantly better in the AcrySof SN60AT group than in the AF-1 YA-60BB group (P = .0313); 9% contrast visual acuity was significantly better in the AcrySof SN60AT group from 6 months onward.

Prospective randomized clinical trial.
Eyes with cataract and less than 1.0 diopter (D) of corneal astigmatism were randomized to receive bilateral implantation of Finevision Micro F trifocal IOLs or Acrysof IQ Restor +3.0 bifocal IOLs. Outcome measures were monocular and binocular uncorrected distance (UDVA), uncorrected intermediate (UIVA), and uncorrected near (UNVA) visual acuities; refractive outcomes; binocular defocus curve; contrast sensitivity; reading speed; patient satisfaction; and spectacle independence.
Six months postoperatively, the mean binocular UDVA, UIVA, and UNVA in 56 eyes of 28 patients were 0.01 logMAR ± 0.11 (SD), 0.32 ± 0.15 logMAR, and 0.15 ± 0.13 logMAR in the trifocal group (n = 15) and 0.00 ± 0.09 logMAR, 0.28 ± 0.08 logMAR, and 0.12 ± 0.08 logMAR in the bifocal group (n = 13), respectively. The trifocal group showed a more continuous defocus curve and better results at -1.0 D of defocus (P < .01). The mean mesopic contrast sensitivity was higher in the bifocal group (P = .02). Complete spectacle independence was reported by 80% of trifocal patients and 50% of bifocal patients. There were no significant differences in refractive outcomes, reading speed, or patient satisfaction.

The spherical aberrations were 0.0021 ± 0.096 for group A, 0.048 ± 0.071 for group B and 0.11 ± 0.089 for group C, indicating a significantly lower magnitude in group A (p = 0.012). In addition, group A showed significantly better results in contrast sensitivity under mesopic (p = 0.042) and photopic (p = 0.047, 0.049) conditions at low spatial frequencies. Nevertheless, postoperative patient satisfaction was not different among the three groups.
The Tecnis Z9003(®) IOL reduced spherical aberrations and improved contrast sensitivity under mesopic and photopic conditions at low spatial frequencies. Nevertheless, the final visual quality was not different among the three groups.","The Tecnis Z9003(®) IOL reduced spherical aberrations and improved contrast sensitivity under mesopic and photopic conditions at low spatial frequencies.

A private practice in Marshalltown, Iowa, USA.
In a review of 2630 consecutive cases operated on from January 2000 through July 2001, ease of IOL insertion and integrity of the haptic architecture were evaluated in a prospective fashion at implantation. Subgroups of cases were studied prospectively to evaluate 3 factors: same-day incision competence after implantation (postoperative intraoperative pressure [IOP], 107 cases); 2- to 5-week A-constant validation (200 cases); 1-day, 2-week, and 1- and 5-month descriptions of optic centration with respect to pupil and capsule anatomy (79 cases); and a 1-day versus 9-month photographic comparison of IOL centration (70 cases). A retrospective evaluation of the population's diagnostic codes tabulated complications including increased postoperative iritis, cystoid macular edema, neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser intervention for posterior capsule opacification, and pseudophakic dysphotopsia. A retrospective review of a subgroup of 140 consecutive cases was done to categorize postoperative optic clarity.
Overall, the IOLs were easy to implant with no haptic or optic damage using a forceps or the Monarch injector. Subgroup studies confirmed good performance in the following parameters: There were no cases of incision incompetence evidenced by an abnormally low postoperative IOP. The lowest postoperative IOP was 6 mm Hg, with the overall mean IOP increasing to 29 mm Hg from the 17 mm Hg measured a mean of 102 minutes after surgery. The manufacturer's published A-constant was almost identical to that obtained in review (118.4 versus 118.38 for the SA30AL and 118.35 for the SA60AT). In verbal descriptions, IOL optic centration was assessed to be within 0.4 mm of perfect in 75 (95%) of 79 cases. Slitlamp photographs showed that 52 (98%) of 53 IOLs were in the same position 9 months after surgery as on the day of surgery. One IOL optic appeared to rotate 14 degrees. There were no cases of decentration greater than 1.0 mm in either optic centration subgroup. Given a normal postoperative topical steroid regimen, there were no cases of substantially increased or prolonged iritis. There were 17 cases (0.65%) of macular edema. An Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy was performed in 0.64% (13/2044) in the SA30AL group over a mean of 9 months (range 2 to 23 months) and in 0.34% (2/586) in the SA60AL group over a mean of 5.5 months (range 5 to 6 months). Pseudophakic dysphotopsia was diagnosed in 26 eyes of 18 patients (1% of 2630 cases), with 1 patient requiring an IOL exchange. Optic glistenings were observed in 11 (11%) of 100 SA30AL cases at a mean follow-up of 8 months. No glistenings in 40 cases were seen in the SA60AT group at a mean follow-up of 3 months.
The single-piece acrylic lenses performed well in all regards. Although not as intense as observed with the earlier 3-piece designs, pseudophakic dysphotopsia occurred in a few patients with the single-piece acrylic lens. Intraocular lens exchanges with single-piece IOLs may be accomplished with less difficulty early rather than late.",,,"Overall, the IOLs were easy to implant with no haptic or optic damage using a forceps or the Monarch injector.

Prospective observer- and patient-masked randomized trial.
Bilateral small-incision cataract surgery with implantation of a hydrophobic acrylic single-piece intraocular lens (IOL) (Tecnis ZCB00) was performed using a standard technique. Each patient received a CTR in 1 eye (CTR group) and no CTR in the fellow eye (control group). The ACD was measured preoperatively with biometry (IOLMaster 500) and at 1 hour and 12 weeks postoperatively using partial coherence interferometry (ACMaster). The subjective refraction was assessed at 12 weeks.
Sixty eyes (30 patients) were included. Preoperatively, the mean axial length was 23.36 mm ± 1.55 (SD) (range 21.01 to 29.46 mm) in the CTR group and 23.37 ± 1.70 mm (range 21.14 to 28.84 mm) in the control group and the mean ACD was 3.06 ± 0.45 mm (range 2.25 to 4.16 mm) and 3.03 ± 0.47 mm (range 2.18 to 4.10 mm), respectively. The differences were not statistically significant (P=.148 and P=.074, respectively).

The purpose of this study was to compare these aspects after the implantation of two different IOL materials.
Thirty-six cataract patients were randomised to receive two different foldable lens: an acrylic hydrophobic IOL (Acrysof MA30BA) and a heparin surface-modified (HSM) polymethylmethacrylate IOL (Pharmacia & Upjohn 809C) after phacoemulsification. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy with specular technique was used to assess the inflammatory cell adhesion on the anterior IOL surface, anterior capsule opacification (ACO) and membrane growth from the rhexis edge at 7, 30, 90, 180 and 360 days after surgery.
The 809C group showed a higher percentage of patients with slight inflammatory cell adhesion on the anterior cell surface and a higher small cellular density during the whole follow-up period. The epithelioid cell response was greater in the 809C group than the Acrysof group but the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. The ACO increased during the follow-up in both groups but was significantly higher in the 809C group.
Acrysof lenses are more biocompatible than HSM IOLs, showing a lower grade of inflammatory cell adhesion and ACO. The implantation of these lenses may be particularly indicated in patients with pathologies predisposing to blood-aqueous barrier damage.","Acrysof lenses are more biocompatible than HSM IOLs, showing a lower grade of inflammatory cell adhesion and ACO.
