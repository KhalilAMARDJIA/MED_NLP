1257;3234187;Prevention of IOP-rise following Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy with topical timolol and indomethacin.;[];Documenta ophthalmologica. Advances in ophthalmology;Short term observation following Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy indicates that serious elevation of intra-ocular pressure may occur, unrelated to the amount of incident energy used. In this study we evaluated the effect of pre-treatment with anti-prostaglandin eyedrops on the rise in IOP. The IOP in forty pseudophakic patients, undergoing Nd-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy, was measured before capsulotomy and 2 and 4 hours afterwards. The fellow-eye was used as a control. Thirty minutes pre-operatively the patients were given one of the four following combinations of eyedrops: 1 drop timolol 0.5% and 1 drop placebo, 1 drop indomethacin 1% and 1 drop placebo, 1 drop timolol 0.5% and 1 drop indomethacin 1%, 1 drop placebo and 1 drop placebo. Statistical analysis of the results showed that indomethacin alone has little influence on the IOP-rise, whereas timolol has. When indomethacin is added to timolol there is no significant enhancement.;;;;;10.1007/BF00154456;1988-10-01;[{'lastname': 'Van der Feltz van der Sloot', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Stilma', 'firstname': 'J S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Boen-Tan', 'firstname': 'T N', 'initials': 'TN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bezemer', 'firstname': 'P D', 'initials': 'PD', 'affiliation': None}];;;;IOP;forty pseudophakic patients;

Sodium hyaluronate 1% vs hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2%.;[];Acta ophthalmologica;We conducted a study to evaluate the shortterm effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) following extracapsular cataract extraction using either sodium hyaluronate 1% or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2%. In both groups a non-significant rise in IOP at day 1 was followed by a significant decline in IOP at day 3 to values below the pre-operative level (p < 0.05). At day 7 both groups had returned to pre-operative values. Post-operatively, spikes in intraocular pressure (> 25 mmHg) were seen equally in both groups. Patients with pre-operatively diagnosed open-angle glaucoma, high myopia and diabetic retinopathy are considered to be at high risk concerning post-operatively elevated IOP, but with small variation these patients followed the main trend.;;;;;10.1111/j.1755-3768.1993.tb04985.x;1993-04-01;[{'lastname': 'Storr-Paulsen', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.'}];diabetic retinopathy	high myopia;;;intraocular pressure (> 25 mmHg)	intraocular pressure (IOP);;

19 investigational sites in 4 countries: Australia, Canada, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
Prospective, randomized, parallel-group, controlled, assessor- and patient-masked clinical study.
Participants aged ≥22 years with bilateral cataracts were randomized to DFT015 or SN60WF in a 5:4 ratio and masked until final postoperative follow-up at month 6. The primary effectiveness objective was superiority of DFT015 over SN60WF in mean monocular photopic distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) at month 3. Secondary effectiveness objectives included noninferiority of DFT015 to SN60WF in mean monocular photopic corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and superiority in the mean monocular photopic distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) at month 3. Visual disturbances were assessed at month 6.
282 patients were randomized to DFT015 (n = 159) or SN60WF (n = 123). All effectiveness objectives were achieved at month 3 in first eyes. For monocular photopic results in first eyes, DFT015 demonstrated superior mean DCIVA (least squares means of -0.139 logMAR in favor of DFT015, P < .001), noninferior mean CDVA (97.5% upper confidence limit [UCL] of the difference was <0.1 logMAR) and superior mean DCNVA (95% UCL of the difference was <0.0 logMAR) compared with SN60WF at month 6. DFT015 exhibited a similar visual disturbance profile to that of SN60WF.

54 patients (54 eyes) with more than 0.75 diopter (D) of preexisting corneal astigmatism were classified as group A (0.75-1.50D) or group B (1.75-2.50D). The patients were randomized to undergo Toric-IOL or PCRIs in the steep axis with spherical IOL implantation. LogMAR uncorrected visual acuity (LogMAR UCVA), LogMAR best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR BCVA), error of vector (|EV|), surgery induced refraction correction (|SIRC|), and correction rates (CR) were measured 1 month and 6 months postoperatively.
At 6 months postoperatively, all 54 eyes had LogMAR BCVA ≤ 0.2. Patients who underwent PCRIs and Toric-IOL with LogMAR BCVA ≤ 0.1 showed no significant differences in group A (P = 1.00) or in group B (P = 0.59). Group A showed no significant differences in LogMAR UCVA (P = 0.70), |EV| (P = 0.13), |SIRC| (P = 0.71), and CR (P = 0.56) in patients underwent PCRIs and Toric-IOL.

Measurements with the Kowa laser flare meter FC-500 were done before surgery and at 1, 6 and 21 days following standard phacoemulsification with corneal incision in 157 patients. The patients were randomized in four groups to receive HSM IOL (group I), foldable acrylic IOL (group II), foldable three-piece silicone (group III), and foldable single-piece silicone (group IV).
Overall, mean flare values were increased at D1, and decreased rapidly to normal values at D21. Intragroup analysis showed a slight increase of flare value observed in the PMMA group (p = 0.0015) and silicone monobloc group (p = 0.001) at D21 compared to D0.

One eye of each patient was randomly assigned to receive BSS Plus, and the other eye to receive S-MA2. BSS Plus caused significantly less corneal swelling on the first postoperative day than did S-MA2. There was no difference between the two solutions in their effect on corneal thickness one week and one month postoperatively. Computer assisted morphometric analysis of wide-field specular microscopic photographs demonstrated minimal changes in endothelial morphological characteristics in the eyes irrigated with BSS Plus.

and methods: A GBR anterior chamber lens with angular supports was implanted in 44 eyes between November 2001 and February 2004. These eyes were highly myopic (preoperative mean of -10.65 +/- 2.62 diopters (D) (range, -6.25 to -16.50 D). Visual acuity, refraction, biomicroscopy, and quality of vision were estimated with a follow-up of 3 years. The potential complications required endothelial density, mobility of the pupil, intraocular pressure, and gonioscopy measurements.
No severe intra- or postoperative complications required an ablation of the lens. Increased intraocular pressure in three cases and decentration in one were the most serious side effects reported. Eighteen eyes (40.9%) presented pupil ovalization; 68.2% of the eyes reached the attempted correction +/-0.50 D. Implants seemed stable in their position and refractive results. Functional signs included night glare for eight patients (18.2%) and glare in the sun for 11 (25%). There was no significant decrease in cellular endothelial density mean during follow-up.
